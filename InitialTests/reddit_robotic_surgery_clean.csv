Autonomous robot surgeon removes organs with 100% success rate

We're a step closer to entering an operating theater without any human life besides ours, following the world's first surgery performed by a robot responding and learning in real time. Its precision and skill matched that of experienced surgeons.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University trained a robot on videos of operations, and then had it conduct a gallbladder removal on its own – with no mechanical help, just voice commands, like a theater team assisting the lead surgeon. Named SRT-H (Surgical Robot Transformer-Hierarchy), the robot absorbed its training and converted it to practice, with the ability to extract the gallbladder time and time again, and adjusting in real-time when needed.

While this study details SRT-H's complete gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) across eight different surgeries, it's worth noting these were performed on a realistic human-like model, but, understandably, not a human. However, the tissues used in the human-like models closely mimicked ours, and the robot breezed through the operation that required 17 tasks to be performed, each lasting minutes. It was able to identify specific ducts and arteries and grab them precisely, strategically place clips and sever parts with scissors.

comment,Futurology,"This is a very cool development, that I'm sure will continue to take great strides over the coming decades. That being said, this headline is misleading. It doesn't ""remove organs"", as in any organ. This particular project was on cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal). It uses real videos for learning, but it hasn't operated on a real person, but rather only uses models. Any surgeon will tell you that the models never quite fully replicate the real thing and the real challenges. No model I've seen actually feels/behaves like real human tissue, it doesn't bleed, there won't be scar tissue from prior surgeries or prior infection, etc. It's like having a race car driver compete against an AI on Mario kart and then claiming the AI performance matched experienced race car drivers. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm really excited about this! However, I think we're a really long way off from these robots operating independently on the full variability of human anatomy with equivalent outcomes to a human surgeon. I anticipate the first step will be more like driver assistance features (E.g. Warning! You are about to enter the left hepatic artery. Would you like to proceed?)

comment,todayilearned,"Physician here. I'm not a general surgeon, but I'm going into a procedural field (interventional radiology to be precise) so I do have some perspective as far as that goes. 

This article is a bit ridiculous and misleading. A surgeon could apprentice someone who has never been to medical school on how to do pretty much any type of procedure. That's not the hard part *per se.*

What you **really** need to learn is the cognitive aspect of surgery. Why am I taking this patient to the OR? Are they a good surgical candidate? What happens when something doesn't go as planned? How is the tissue going to react to what I want to do? What happens when you open and find something you didn't expect? 

The most challenging part of surgery isn't tying knots or making cuts. It's knowing when to take the right patient to the right surgery at the right time, and knowing how to solve problems as the come up so you can get out of trouble when you're operating.

post,artificial,"I work in healthcare…AI is garbage.
I am a hospital-based physician, and despite all the hype, artificial intelligence remains an unpopular subject among my colleagues. Not because we see it as a competitor, but because—at least in its current state—it has proven largely useless in our field. I say “at least for now” because I do believe AI has a role to play in medicine, though more as an adjunct to clinical practice rather than as a replacement for the diagnostician. Unfortunately, many of the executives promoting these technologies exaggerate their value in order to drive sales.

I feel compelled to write this because I am constantly bombarded with headlines proclaiming that AI will soon replace physicians. These stories are often written by well-meaning journalists with limited understanding of how medicine actually works, or by computer scientists and CEOs who have never cared for a patient.

The central flaw, in my opinion, is that AI lacks nuance. Clinical medicine is a tapestry of subtle signals and shifting contexts. A physician’s diagnostic reasoning may pivot in an instant—whether due to a dramatic lab abnormality or something as delicate as a patient’s tone of voice. AI may be able to process large datasets and recognize patterns, but it simply cannot capture the endless constellation of human variables that guide real-world decision making.

Yes, you will find studies claiming AI can match or surpass physicians in diagnostic accuracy. But most of these experiments are conducted by computer scientists using oversimplified vignettes or outdated case material—scenarios that bear little resemblance to the complexity of a live patient encounter.

Take EKGs, for example. A lot of patients admitted to the hospital requires one. EKG machines already use computer algorithms to generate a preliminary interpretation, and these are notoriously inaccurate. That is why both the admitting physician and often a cardiologist must review the tracings themselves. Even a minor movement by the patient during the test can create artifacts that resemble a heart attack or dangerous arrhythmia. I have tested anonymized tracings with AI models like ChatGPT, and the results are no better: the interpretations were frequently wrong, and when challenged, the model would retreat with vague admissions of error.

The same is true for imaging. AI may be trained on billions of images with associated diagnoses, but place that same technology in front of a morbidly obese patient or someone with odd posture  and the output is suddenly unreliable. On chest xrays, poor tissue penetration can create images that mimic pneumonia or fluid overload, leading AI astray. Radiologists, of course, know to account for this.

In surgery, I’ve seen  glowing references to “robotic surgery.” In reality, most surgical robots are nothing more than precision instruments controlled entirely by the surgeon who remains in the operating room, one of the benefits being that they do not have to scrub in. The robots are tools—not autonomous operators.

Someday, AI may become a powerful diagnostic tool in medicine. But its greatest promise, at least for now, lies not in diagnosis or treatment but in administration: things lim scheduling and billing. As it stands today, its impact on the actual practice of medicine has been minimal.

EDIT:

Thank you so much for all your responses. I’d like to address all of them individually but time is not on my side 🤣.  

1) the headline was intentional rage bait to invite you to partake in the conversation. My messages that AI in clinical practice has not lived up to the expectations of the sales pitch. I acknowledge that it is not computer scientists, but rather executives and middle management, that are responsible for this.  They exaggerate the current merits of AI to increase sales. 

2) I’m very happy that people that have a foot in each door - medicine and computer science - chimed in and gave very insightful feedback.  I am also thankful to the physicians who mentioned the pivotal role AI plays in minimizing our administrative burden, As I mentioned in my original post, this is where the technology has been most impactful.  It seems that most MDs responding appear confirm my sentiments with regards the minimal diagnostic value of AI.

3) My reference to ChatGPT with respect to my own clinical practice was in relation to comparing its efficacy to our error prone EKG interpreting AI technology that we use in our  hospital.

4) Physician medical errors seem to be a point of contention. I’m so sorry to anyone to anyone whose family member has been affected by this. It’s a daunting task to navigate the process of correcting medical errors, especially if you are not familiar with the diagnosis, procedures, or administrative nature of the medical decision making process.   I think it’s worth mentioning that one of the studies that were referenced point to a medical error mortality rate of less than 1% -specifically the Johns Hopkins study (which is more of a literature review). Unfortunately, morbidity does not seem to be mentioned so I can’t account for that but it’s fair to say that a mortality rate of 0.71% of all admissions is a pretty reassuring figure.  Parse that with the error rates of AI and I think one would be more impressed with the human decision making process.

5) Lastly, I’m sorry the word tapestry was so provocative. Unfortunately it took away from the conversation but I’m glad at the least people can have some fun at my expense 😂.

The most essential part of surgery, in  a very simplified way:   
is the presentation of anatomy which is different for each patient with consideration to abnormal anatomy, the presence or absence of adhesions (organs being stuck to each other, sometimes its stuck like how your skin get stuck to fevikwick/super glue)  and its severity, then tissue handling since every tissue in the body responds differently to how you handle it and tissue strength varies from person to person and also the disease state of the tissue.  
After that is the dissection, handling of intra-operative complications/bleeding which only comes with experience.

post,STEW_ScTecEngWorld,"Eye surgery for age-related macular degeneration: German researchers develop an eye surgery robot that prepares in minutes and injects with micron precision
***New robot delivers ultra-precise syringes and is quickly ready for use*** \- Even many surgeons now admit that medical robots can operate with greater precision than human surgeons. However, the complex preparation for robotic surgeries still takes far too long. The new robotic assistant for eye surgery for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), developed by the Technical University of Munich (TUM), on the other hand, is ready to operate in just under five minutes. Doctors currently treat AMD with medications injected into the side of the eye. The robot is capable of delivering injections with a deviation of just 15 micrometers into the 200 micrometer-thick retina. This delivers the drug precisely to the right spot, where it can block a growth factor that, if left unchecked, would lead to blindness. Currently, almost 200 million people worldwide suffer from the disease; by 2040, this number is expected to rise to more than 280 million. People over 60 are particularly affected, with AMD being the cause of almost one in ten cases of blindness among them.

Summary:


**Autonomous Robot Surgeon Achieves 100% Success Rate in Gallbladder Removal**

A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University has developed an autonomous robot surgeon, named SRT-H (Surgical Robot Transformer-Hierarchy), that can perform gallbladder removal surgery with a 100% success rate. The key highlights:

- SRT-H was trained on videos of surgical procedures and was able to conduct the full gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) operation on its own, using only voice commands.
- The robot demonstrated the ability to adapt and understand the surgical procedure in real-time, adjusting its actions as needed, rather than just following a pre-programmed script.
- SRT-H achieved a 100% success rate in eight different gallbladder removal surgeries performed on a realistic human-like model.
- The robot uses the same machine learning architecture as ChatGPT, allowing it to respond to spoken commands, correct itself, and learn from experience.
- This breakthrough represents a major advancement in the field of surgical robotics, bringing autonomous surgical systems closer to clinical viability.
- The researchers expect SRT-H to be ready for use on actual human patients within the next decade, as it expands its expertise to perform a variety of autonomous surgical procedures.

This development could have significant implications for the future of surgical care, potentially improving precision, consistency, and accessibility of complex medical procedures.",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConsultantDoctorsUK/comments/1lwzqra/autonomous_robot_surgeon_removes_organs_with_100/,"Autonomous robot surgeon removes organs with 100% success rate Summary: Autonomous Robot Surgeon Achieves 100% Success Rate in Gallbladder Removal A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University has developed an autonomous robot surgeon, named SRT-H Surgical Robot Transformer-Hierarchy, that can perform gallbladder removal surgery with a 100% success rate.

""Research on autonomous surgery has largely focused on simple task automation in controlled environments. However, real-world surgical applications demand dexterous manipulation over extended durations and robust generalization to the inherent variability of human tissue. These challenges remain difficult to address using existing logic-based or conventional end-to-end learning strategies. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical framework for performing dexterous, long-horizon surgical steps. Our approach uses a high-level policy for task planning and a low-level policy for generating low-level trajectories. The high-level planner plans in language space, generating task-level or corrective instructions that guide the robot through the long-horizon steps and help recover from errors made by the low-level policy. We validated our framework through ex vivo experiments on cholecystectomy, a commonly practiced minimally invasive procedure, and conducted ablation studies to evaluate key components of the system. Our method achieves a 100% success rate across eight different ex vivo gallbladders, operating fully autonomously without human intervention. The hierarchical approach improved the policy’s ability to recover from suboptimal states that are inevitable in the highly dynamic environment of realistic surgical applications.

post,BB_Stock,"From Assembly Lines to Surgery: Why China Trusts Robots — and QNX Makes It Possible

On April 30 and May 6, 2025, BlackBerry's QNX division released a two-part global research report showing a significant rise in the adoption of robotics in workplaces, with China emerging as the clear leader in both implementation and trust. The data, based on a survey conducted between March 5 and March 14, 2025, among 1,000 senior decision-makers in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, and heavy industry, highlights not only a rapid global shift toward automation, but also the growing importance of trust, safety, and performance as key enablers.

Globally, 77% of technology leaders now say they trust robots to perform critical workplace functions. In China, that number rises to a striking 92%. Furthermore, 89% of Chinese companies have already adopted some form of robotics, significantly above the global average of 50%. Chinese executives also expect that 32% of jobs will be automated by robotics within the next decade—compared to 20% globally.

The most common uses of robots include automation, manufacturing, logistics, support functions, and high-risk environments. What drives trust in these machines? The report identifies two primary factors: proven reliability and performance (cited by 43% of Chinese respondents), and strong safety and risk control mechanisms (40%). These elements are especially crucial when humans work alongside robots, where even small software failures can lead to serious consequences.

Comfort levels vary across industries and use cases. In China, most respondents feel positive about robot collaboration on structured tasks such as assembly lines (94%) and logistics (90%). However, this comfort drops in sensitive or complex fields—such as robotic-assisted surgery—where only 74% feel at ease, and 25% express clear discomfort. This mirrors global attitudes, where robots are welcomed for repetitive or dangerous work, but met with hesitation in areas requiring empathy, precision, or human judgment.

Despite strong adoption, safety remains a concern. Globally, 58% of respondents are worried about the cybersecurity risks that robotics introduce, and 29% report actual safety incidents involving robots. In China, 31% of respondents share safety concerns, and 24% have experienced robot-related accidents first-hand. These figures show that while trust in technology is growing, it remains fragile and must be supported by robust safety systems, transparent governance, and resilient infrastructure.

This is where BlackBerry QNX plays a foundational role. While often invisible to end users, QNX’s technology is essential to the safe and secure functioning of robotic systems. The company provides real-time operating systems (RTOS), hypervisors, middleware, and development tools designed specifically for high-stakes environments like robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and industrial automation.

QNX software is known for its reliability—used in over 255 million vehicles globally—and is trusted by nine of the world’s ten largest medical device manufacturers. It’s designed for systems that simply cannot fail: surgical robots, autonomous forklifts, or factory arms handling dangerous tasks. With features such as real-time responsiveness, functional safety certification, and robust cybersecurity, QNX ensures that robots perform precisely and safely, even under complex, time-sensitive conditions.

Beyond technology, China’s leadership also reflects alignment between policy, industry, and workforce culture. The May 6 report notes that 81% of Chinese tech leaders are satisfied with their country’s AI and robotics regulations—compared with a global average of the same—suggesting that regulation is not viewed as a bottleneck but as a supportive framework. Even more striking, 99% of Chinese executives believe that employees should be actively involved in decisions around robotics adoption, reinforcing the importance of trust-building not just with machines, but within teams.

In essence, China’s robotics leadership is not simply a matter of technology—it’s a result of coordinated progress across innovation, governance, and organizational culture. And while China leads in many metrics, the global trend is undeniable: we are entering an era where robotics will fundamentally reshape how work is done. But for this transition to succeed, it must be built on trust—trust in performance, in safety, and in the software that connects it all.

BlackBerry QNX is positioned at the core of this shift. By delivering safe, secure, and dependable software platforms, QNX enables companies worldwide to confidently adopt robotics without compromising the well-being of workers or the reliability of operations. As industries evolve and automation accelerates, the companies that prioritize safety, trust, and strong system foundations will be the ones who define the next industrial era.

**Techno-optimist narrative**: This is a revolutionary leap toward safer, more accessible healthcare. This robot's 100% success rate and ability to adapt to real-world surgical complications demonstrate that AI can match expert human performance, reduce surgical errors, and expand access to quality care in underserved areas. 

**Techno-skeptic narrative**: While impressive, significant safety concerns remain before human trials can begin. The robot required self-correction six times per case and needed human intervention to change instruments, raising questions about reliability in life-threatening situations where split-second decisions matter most.

post,AnythingGoesNews,"AI robot performs autonomous gallbladder surgery with 100% precision - learned only from watching surgical videos
This is absolutely incredible. A Johns Hopkins AI robot just performed part of a **gallbladder removal with 100% precision and zero human intervention**. The system learned solely from surgical videos and verbal commands, adapting in real time like a human surgeon would.

This isn't just a medical breakthrough - it's proof that AI can master complex, high-stakes physical tasks through observation alone. The robot didn't need specialized training data or thousands of practice runs. It watched surgery videos and figured out how to operate on a living person with perfect precision.

The implications are staggering. If AI can learn surgery from videos, what other skilled professions are about to be revolutionized? This technology could bring world-class surgical care to remote areas where specialists aren't available. But it also means we're approaching a world where AI doesn't just assist humans - it can fully replace them in tasks requiring judgment, dexterity, and real-time adaptation. The fact that this happened with current technology means we're probably just years away from AI surgeons being better than human ones.",2,https://skimz.ai,"AI robot performs autonomous gallbladder surgery with 100% precision - learned only from watching surgical videos This is absolutely incredible.

*The Great P'Thok and Beloved Matron Mi'Luki almost caused a civil war, their discoveries were so profoundly impactful on Treana'ad society. Our society had been unchanged for millions of years, no change was possible any longer as far as everyone could determine. We had resigned ourselves to our society, our culture, and hateful biology. Like other species, tens of thousands, millions of years was required for any movement in the homeostasis of our societies.*

*Then the Great P'Thok blew a hole in our culture and Beloved Matron Mi'Luki drove an ice cream truck through it. By the time we had settled down, by the time war was averted by the very things that changed our society, the Terran-Mantid Wars were over, the Republic, the Combine, even the Imperium had fallen. The Digital Omnimessiah had been assassinated and the Biological Apostles, the Immortals, had vanished.*

*In the time it took us to decide if Blueberry Cream Powersmoker Flavor should be legal for certain age groups of Matrons, the Fourth Republic had fallen and the Concordiant had risen to power.*

*Terran society* always *had a Great P'Thok, there were Beloved Matron Mi'Luki's everywhere.*

*For us, it was ice cream, birth control, and cigarettes.*

*For Terrans, it was simply being a Terran.* \- From: *Reflections Upon Change*, philosopher P'latret, 545 PG

The hospital room was quiet, just a low hum of electronics and the gentle whisper of the environmental system that kept the room at the optimum temperature for the patient's health and keeping down the spread of microorganisms through temperature regulation.

Normally two species did not share a room, but this room had a null-g hospital bed for a small green mantid tucked up next to a larger bed for a Hakanian. The Hakanian twisted and writhed, despite the anesthetic beam, moaning out loud and muttering fragments of speech. The green mantid would jerk, his three legs scrabbling, the regen cast where the missing leg had been clicking now and then, and data would stream down the computer screens.

On the other side of the viewing window, in the observation room, stood a gold mantid, a russet mantid, and a Rigellian female, one a psychic surgeon, one a medical surgeon, the other a Defense Services Intelligence Agency officer. Against the wall stood two women, short, thick bodied, black hair, in suits and apparently unarmed, their gunmetal gray eyes staring straight ahead.

Confederate Intelligence Agents.

The gold mantid opened a window in the smartglass and scrolled through the data.

""The dream blocker medication is working somewhat, but those aren't dreams, they're implanted memories,"" the gold mantid, one *Finds Common Ground*, said. She shook her head. ""I'll tell you the truth, I'm somewhat concerned about what you're asking me to do.""

The russet mantid, one *Never Give You Up*, nodded. ""We need you to seal off the implanted memories so that we can at least ask how the patient came into possession of them.""

On cue the maimed features of the Atrekna with the burning red eyes appeared on the dream monitor and the Hakanian gave a low moan of pain and terror.

""An Enraged Atrekna,"" the russet mantid said softly, shaking her head and tapping the tips of her cybernetically enhanced bladearms together. ""There is a high probability that the injuries to his face and head and hand were incurred in combat against a Terran.""

The Rigellian female nodded, rubbing the knuckles of one hand with the palm of another, trying to ease her anxiety at the sight of the Atrekna as the remaining feeding tentacles writhed slowly and obscenely and the eyes drew closer until they blottted out everything else.

""Has there been a record of Atrekna freeing any prisoners?"" *Finds* asked.

""No,"" the Rigellian, one Tiffany Gawarkrawk, said quietly. ""Nor has there ever been any sightings of an Atrekna like the one that delivered the patient to the SAR platoon.""

*Finds* sighed deeply, reaching out and putting a hand against the smartglass wall and closing her eyes. Her antenna flicked back and forth for a moment then steadied. A low silvery purple nimbus surrounded her antenna.

""His mental defenses are sliced apart. Not with brute force, this was done by someone skilled. I'd say the red-eyed Atrekna is experienced at this,"" the gold one said. She suddenly shuddered and pulled back. ""I can taste Red Eyes all over the thoughts.

She paused for a moment.

""It's Enraged. One taste of his phasic touch and you can feel it. Not as bad as a non-Enraged Terran, but you can still taste it,"" *Finds* said. She shook her head again. ""Prepare a psychic surgery theater and alert a psychic surgery team.""

She closed the data window.

""I'll try to see if he's still in there.""

\-----

*small*

*silent*

*still*

Yrler floated in a dark bubble. Images kept appearing, rubbing against the walls of the bubble. He ignored them even as another part of his brain screamed in terror, in agony, the screams translating into low moans through the medication.

He was in the fetal position, wrapped up, eyes closed, ears pressed against the side of his head, tail protecting his butt crack and genitals as it arced beneath him.

*small*

*still*

*silent*

""Does. It. Hurt?"" the strange voice of the naked Atrekna, sounding like a badly recorded female lemur.

*small*

*still*

*silent*

Yrler didn't know what was happening to his body.

It didn't matter.

He was somewhere else now. Beyond his body. Beyond safe memories. Beyond everything to the point that nothing could truly reach him.

*survive*

*escape*

*resist*

*evasion*

He was within all three. He had survived his injuries so far, had survived those razor sharp fingers rooting through his memories, his thoughts, touching his soul.

He had escaped their touch, their punishments on his already battered body, their assaults upon his mind.

He couldn't feel his body any longer but that was good.

He had escaped beyond their reach.

He was past resisting. His memories were his own, but they were disconnected, no longer attached, protected by the fact that his brain no longer processed memories, no longer made neural function calls to his long term, mid-term, or even short term or immediate memory clusters.

He resisted by having escaped.

*small*

*still*

*silent*

He could evade them now. He was beyond them, outside their reach.

Free. Candy?

The memory whispered at him, a distorted female lemur voice, but it wafted past him like an ill wind and he paid it no mind.

He was the bubble on the night sea, the pollen in the night air.

*small*

*silent*

*still*

He knew he was screaming somewhere else. Knew he was writhing in pain.

But he had escaped the pain.

He floated in warm blackness, curled into the fetal position.

""Peflar? Pelfar? Can you hear me?"" reverberated through the darkness.

*small*

*silent*

*still*

Yrler felt himself slowly rotate. Heard the faint pleasant gurgle of bubbles in dark warm water.

""Pelfar? I'm Doctor *Finds the Common Ground.* Can you hear me? You're in a Confederate Military Medical Center. Pelfar?""

*the enemy will attempt to trick you. reject their words even if it is just simply ignoring them. listen but let the words pass through you. do not reply do not engage until you see your opportunity*

""Pelfar? I'm Doctor *Finds the Common Ground*. I'm a psychic surgeon. I suspect you are in here. Please respond.""

*small*

*silent*

*still*

*resist*

*evade*

*survive*

Yrler ignored it all, not even dignifying the enemy's attempt with a response, his mind blank, as he floated inside the bubble.

\-----

""He's still in there,"" *Finds* said. ""I can't find him, but he's in there.""

""SERE training,"" the Rigellian said. She tapped the smartglass. ""He's been trained in psychic warfare counter-measures. He won't respond unless you give the correct key phrases.""

""You should give them to me so I can bring him out of it,"" *Finds* said.

Lieutenant Colonel Gawarkrawk shook her head. ""Not yet. His brain, his thoughts, his *mind* was touched by a creature we know almost nothing about. It ripped apart his mind and implanted memories,"" she tapped the smartglass and brought up the image of the disfigured red-eyed Atrekna. ""Old Red-Eyes here was enraged to boot. Think about that. He had an Atrekna, arguably more skilled than even your people, root around in his brain *and* the Atrekna was Enraged.""

LTC Gawarkrawk shifted the screen slightly to show the green mantid. ""You can try him.""

\-----

515 lay on the rock, sunning himself. Around him a holoprojector was playing his favorite song.

*one and one is two two and two is four four and four is eight eight quacky duckies swim with four hopping frogs singing two songs in one pond warm blanket soft blanket red block is square blue triangle is blue green circle is funny*

He was tiny. No bigger than a credit chip. His implants were the size of grains of sand, mostly nonfunctional, the nanotech systems growing slowly with him.

He could sense the spectral output of the star, taste the chemical composition of the particles on the wind, see the stresses the wind put on the stalks of purple grass beneath a violet sky.

""Five One Five! Are you in there?"" the voice asked from far away.

*spooky sounds are spooky but you are safe with broodmommy* the song sang

""Five One Five, this is *Finds the Common Ground*, please respond.""

515 just ignored it, closing his eyes, turning off his antenna.

*warm greenie smart greenie clever greenie safe greenie*

The song wound around him, moved through him, lifted him beyond.

He knew that part of his mind was screaming, shrieking out the equations carved into his mind by the burning razored edge of the red-eyed Atrekna's mind domination.

But he was beyond that.

*smart greenie clever greenie one and one is two two and two is four four and four is eight*

The song continued as he ignored the voice.

It was the enemy. An enemy trick.

The red eyed Atrekna and its bizarre friends would not break him. He would not comply. He would not answer.

He was 515.

And he was warm and smart and clever and brave

*smart greenie clever greenie brave greenie*

\-----

""I can't reach him. He's so far down I'm not even sure he's conscious,"" *Finds* said.

LTC Gawarkrawk noted that the gold mantid looked exhausted.

""Those equations he keeps repeating, they're branded into his psyche with a blowtorch.""

""Do we know what they are?"" LTC Gawarkrawk asked, turning to one of her aides.

""Vaguely, yes. Precisely, no,"" the Kobold said.

""Give me a gist?"" the Colonel asked.

The Kobold shrugged. ""We believe a lot of it is data on the hyperatomic plane that we now know as Hellspace. There's a lot of technical data that the greenies just stare at in shock. Something about a hyperparticle energetic state non-linear accellerator or something like that,"" the Kobold gave a laugh. ""I'm a trained jumpspace and hyperspace theory scientist and those equations make my eyes cross,"" he paused. ""Another problem is, three quarters of the data is in the same language that the patient keeps mumbling.""

""Which we still don't understand,"" LTC Gawarkrawk cursed, slamming a closed fist against the smartglass.

""It's being theorized that it might be ancient Lanaktallan. From the Precursor War,"" another intelligence specialist said, this one a Pubvian. ""That's our best bet.""

""Let me guess, the Unified Council might have had spaceships from back then, but nobody speaks that old language,"" LTC Gawarkrawk snarled. ""Great. Something this important and it's a dead-end because nobody alive speaks Precursor War Lanaktallan. Nobody speaks the right language, including the advanced mathematics because of lost concepts.""

There was silence for a moment.

One of the women against the wall cleared her throat and took a half-step forward.

Everyone turned and stared.

""That's not... necessarily true,"" the Agent said.

\-----

*Dreams of Something More* watched as the massive Herd Stallion entered her quarters.

It was a glossy black biomechanical nightmare to many. Covered in sleek black armor, pistons and gears and pullies visible here and there, its feet wreathed in flame, it's six eyes burning purplish-red, it's feeding tendrils tipped with shining chrome.

To the Lanaktallan, it was strength, progress, imposing and impressive.

It reminded *Dreams* of the work of a few Terran artists.

The massive black Lanaktallan nodded gravely.

""You wished to hold audience with me, Madame Diplomat?"" the huge black stallion asked, his voice cultured and smoothed, his Confederate Standard Interspecies Common Speech flawless.

""Yes,"" *Dreams* said. She made a motion and a starmap opened up. ""You're familiar with the current state of the Atrekna War?""

The stallion nodded. ""Operation Iron Piglet and all of its operational offensives seemed like an impossible insanity to me. The idea that the Confederacy already had all of that military might in Council Space or bordering it seemed impossible.""

""No species has ever been prepared for our war machine, whether it was the Confederacy's or the governments preceding it,"" *Dreams* said, nodding.

""Everyone is a gangster until the crude directional mine carrying domestic cleaning robot comes around the corner,"" the Lanakallan Herd Stallion rumbled.

*Dreams* smiled and nodded. ""An old saying, but applicable.""

""There has been a development,"" *Dreams* said. ""One that I believe you can help with.""

The Herd Stallion's body language showed curiosity. ""I am willing to assist if I can.""

""Can you speak the ancient Lanaktallan tongue. Not Unified Standard Language, but the ancient tongue of your people from the Percursor War?"" *Dreams* asked.

The Lanaktallan managed to display sorrow even though his face was a plated mask. ""Alas, I can read it, but I cannot speak it. I am willing to try to listen to see if it is understandable to me.""

*Dreams* nodded and reached out. ""Be warned, there's psychic imprinting with the speech that we've been unable to parse.""

""I am warned,"" the huge Lanaktallan stated.

The whisper was low, pain filled, as it wound through the artificially generated temperate rain forest that filled *Dreams's* quarters.

""It is a message of grave importance, that ignoring will bring doom and wide-spread death and destruction,"" the Lanaktallan stated, his eyes closed. "" The phasic messaging is that the message must be attended to, attention to it is of great importance. The Atrekna are desperate and willing to attempt the unthinkable that will be vast and terrible in its destruction.""

The message ended.

""The words, I understood a few. It mentioned the Atrekna several times, there were scientific phrases I did not understand, but I was able to glean the meaning behind the words,"" the Lanaktallan stated. It shuddered. ""A great project, committed by my people, who faced extinction at the hands of the Autonomous War Machines of all three of the Great Triumviant.""

""The PAWM,"" *Dreams* said\*.\* She suddenly sat up straight. ""Oh, my Digital Omnimessiah and the Twelve Biological Apostles,"" she breathed. ""It's about the creation of Hellspace!""

The Lanaktallan nodded. ""I believe you are correct, Madame Diplomat. I had deduced the same thing,"" it shook its great head solemnly. ""Sadly, there is nobody I know of that would understand the engineering from back then. Terms matter with advanced science, and I am not sure just how much we can glean from those whispers.""

*Dreams* nodded. ""Thank you, Honored One.""

The Lanaktallan bowed slightly. ""I but live to serve the Lanaktallan people.""

""Now we just need to figure out how to find someone who can understand the language better and who knows engineering from back then,"" *Dreams* mused.

""I wish you good fortune on your search,"" the Herd Stallion said.

\-----

The sun was warm, a light air current, stronger than a breeze but lighter than wind, floated in from the west, carrying the smell of grain, cattle, and water. The crops waved slowly, a long undulation reminiscent of an ocean. The sky was dotted with white puffy clouds, clear violet to the senses of the few sentient beings on the scattered farms and ranches.

On one such farm slash ranch a massive Mantid warrior caste sat in a rocker, leaning back against the swivel backrest, idly swinging his four legs lazily to make the chair rock back and forth. He had a floppy hat on, holes cut for his sensitive antenna, as well as a leather abdominal wrap, denim vest, and a buckskin satchel on a bead decorated strap.

In his lap sat a fat and pampered fowl, that was slowly being petted with bladearms sharp enough to slice through endosteel. It was making low gobbling noises of happiness as the huge mantid petted it.

Around him, relaxing on small bench-seats with adjustable back rests, were a half dozen green servitors. They were discussing, in their mathematical language, repairs done to one of the tractors.

The massive Mantid warrior, Cordexen by name, felt pride in the engineering servitors.

He enjoyed hearing their chatter.

It banished the loneliness he had suffered for eons.

A pinging from inside the house got his attention and he sighed as he set the snoring turkey down and stood up, the back of the rocking chair automatically swinging out of the way.

He entered his large house, tapping bladearms with a war servitor who was sitting on the couch with a half dozen other black carapace mantids, all watching the edutainment show ""Uncle Mikey"" on the Tri-Vee.

In the communications room the comlink was pinging steadily.

It was slightly surprising to see that it wasn't one of his neighbors or one of the Mantid with whom he had shared the terrible purgatory of the underground mining installation.

It was a call from Confederate Intelligence.

He had no fear as he reached for the accept button. Confederate Intelligence had held little interest for him. Cordexen was more afraid of the media channels and media stars who had wanted to interview him than of CI.

The screen wavered and cleared to show a gold mantid.

Cordexen blinked several times.

She was different than he was used to. Less spikes. Larger head. Longer antenna. Bigger eyes. The carapace angles and lines were different.

""I am *Finds the Common Ground*, a Confederate Armed Services Military Doctor, a psychic surgeon to be precise. May we speak, oh honored elder cousin?"" the gold asked, the translator built into the wondrous comlink translating her speech from Confederate Standard (according to the subtitle) to proper Krikitak Imperial Vocalization.

Cordexen briefly considered shutting off the comlink. She was from another Hive, another bloodline, and the feeling of loss that welled up inside of him was almost stifling.

Instead, he just slowly nodded.

""You fought mainly against the Lanaktallan, correct?"" the gold mantid asked, ignoring the breach of protocol in Cordexen not introducing himself.

Again, Cordexen just nodded.

""Can you understand the Lanaktallan spoken word?"" *Finds* asked.

Cordexen could sense her anxiety, her almost despairing hope, even through the light year gap in the hypercom signal.

Again, he nodded.

""Would you be willing to translate?"" the gold one asked. She blinked twice and Cordexen noted she had a few green freckles on her eyelids.

She would have been tossed into the larval pits for that imperfection by the Krikitak Empire.

Again, Cordexen nodded after standing perfectly still for nearly a minute.

""Another question, honored elder cousin, if I may?"" the gold asked.

Cordexen held still for a long moment.

One of his prize turkeys waddled into the room and rubbed against his leg, making happy gobbling noises.

Cordexen bent down and lifted it up in his hands, petting it slowly with his bladearm.

Finally, he nodded.

""Do you know anyone who understands Lanaktallan engineering in its original language from your time?"" the gold asked.

Cordexen swallowed bitter ichor and ash.

*the rifles flashing as the green servitors worked furiously trying to shut off the rampaging lanaktallan autonomous war machine even as its weapons ripped and tore at the metropolis the scream of machines and mantid the roar of mechanical foes and his own weapons his engineer servitors working furiously spurred on by his own desperation as he and his war servitors pushed the lanaktallan killing machines back with sheer firepower*

Cordexen opened his eyes.

""I apologize greatly for causing you such distress, honored elder cousin,"" the gold said. ""It give me physical pain to know I am causing distress, but this is of such vital importance that I was granted permission to speak with you.""

Cordexen nodded even as he gently petted the happy turkey.

""You do?"" the gold sagged slightly with relief. She looked back up. ""Honored elder cousin, the entire galactic arm, even beyond, is threatened by machinations of the Atrekna that were revealed by this data.""

Cordexen said nothing, just stood there, facing the hologram, petting Corey the Turkey.

""Do you wish to know what it is about before you agree to allow me to transmit the data?"" the gold asked.

Cordexen thought about it, looking to his left, where sunshine was streaming through a gap in the curtains, making a beautiful violet block on the wood.

Finally he turned back and nodded.

""A neural imprint copy of Lanaktallan scientists talking about burning the hyperatomic plane as well as a large amount of engineering data,"" the gold said. ""There is additional speech we cannot identify. As you know, it has been over a hundred and twenty million years since those events.""

Cordexen stared at the violet rectangle of light on the floor.

One of the engineer servitors came in and held up a stalk of wheat to Cordexen.

Cordexen bent down and took it, expressing thanks and pleasure, and stroked the servitor for a moment before it rushed off. He stood up slowly, putting the stalk in his mandibles and staring at the gold.

""Will you allow us to transmit the data to you?"" the gold asked.

Cordexen nodded slowly. He stayed silent as the data packet was transferred.

Before the gold could say anything more, Cordexen went and shut off the call, leaving the data channel open.

He walked quietly out to the porch, sitting down and staring at his crops, at his cattle, and feeling sadness well up inside of him.

*Bedamned all programmers, scientists, and engineers that were so filled with pride they doomed us all twice,* Cordexen thought to himself, staring at the waving stalks. *What you have wrought still ravages the universe even after the stars you saw in the sky have gone out.*

Our society had been unchanged for millions of years, no change was possible any longer as far as everyone could determine. We had resigned ourselves to our society, our culture, and hateful biology. Like other species, tens of thousands, millions of years was required for any movement in the homeostasis of our societies. Then the Great P'Thok blew a hole in our culture and Beloved Matron Mi'Luki drove an ice cream truck through it. By the time we had settled down, by the time war was averted by the very things that changed our society, the Terran-Mantid Wars were over, the Republic, the Combine, even the Imperium had fallen. The Digital Omnimessiah had been assassinated and the Biological Apostles, the Immortals, had vanished. In the time it took us to decide if Blueberry Cream Powersmoker Flavor should be legal for certain age groups of Matrons, the Fourth Republic had fallen and the Concordiant had risen to power. Terran society always had a Great P'Thok, there were Beloved Matron Mi'Luki's everywhere. For us, it was ice cream, birth control, and cigarettes. For Terrans, it was simply being a Terran. \- From: Reflections Upon Change, philosopher P'latret, 545 PG The hospital room was quiet, just a low hum of electronics and the gentle whisper of the environmental system that kept the room at the optimum temperature for the patient's health and keeping down the spread of microorganisms through temperature regulation. Normally two species did not share a room, but this room had a null-g hospital bed for a small green mantid tucked up next to a larger bed for a Hakanian. The Hakanian twisted and writhed, despite the anesthetic beam, moaning out loud and muttering fragments of speech. The green mantid would jerk, his three legs scrabbling, the regen cast where the missing leg had been clicking now and then, and data would stream down the computer screens. On the other side of the viewing window, in the observation room, stood a gold mantid, a russet mantid, and a Rigellian female, one a psychic surgeon, one a medical surgeon, the other a Defense Services Intelligence Agency officer. Against the wall stood two women, short, thick bodied, black hair, in suits and apparently unarmed, their gunmetal gray eyes staring straight ahead. Confederate Intelligence Agents. The gold mantid opened a window in the smartglass and scrolled through the data. ""The dream blocker medication is working somewhat, but those aren't dreams, they're implanted memories,"" the gold mantid, one Finds Common Ground, said. She shook her head. ""I'll tell you the truth, I'm somewhat concerned about what you're asking me to do."" The russet mantid, one Never Give You Up, nodded. ""We need you to seal off the implanted memories so that we can at least ask how the patient came into possession of them."" On cue the maimed features of the Atrekna with the burning red eyes appeared on the dream monitor and the Hakanian gave a low moan of pain and terror. ""An Enraged Atrekna,"" the russet mantid said softly, shaking her head and tapping the tips of her cybernetically enhanced bladearms together. ""There is a high probability that the injuries to his face and head and hand were incurred in combat against a Terran."" The Rigellian female nodded, rubbing the knuckles of one hand with the palm of another, trying to ease her anxiety at the sight of the Atrekna as the remaining feeding tentacles writhed slowly and obscenely and the eyes drew closer until they blottted out everything else. ""Has there been a record of Atrekna freeing any prisoners?"" Finds asked. ""No,"" the Rigellian, one Tiffany Gawarkrawk, said quietly. ""Nor has there ever been any sightings of an Atrekna like the one that delivered the patient to the SAR platoon."" Finds sighed deeply, reaching out and putting a hand against the smartglass wall and closing her eyes. Her antenna flicked back and forth for a moment then steadied. A low silvery purple nimbus surrounded her antenna. ""His mental defenses are sliced apart. Not with brute force, this was done by someone skilled. I'd say the red-eyed Atrekna is experienced at this,"" the gold one said. She suddenly shuddered and pulled back. ""I can taste Red Eyes all over the thoughts. She paused for a moment. ""It's Enraged. One taste of his phasic touch and you can feel it. Not as bad as a non-Enraged Terran, but you can still taste it,"" Finds said. She shook her head again. ""Prepare a psychic surgery theater and alert a psychic surgery team."" She closed the data window. ""I'll try to see if he's still in there."" \----- small silent still Yrler floated in a dark bubble. Images kept appearing, rubbing against the walls of the bubble. He ignored them even as another part of his brain screamed in terror, in agony, the screams translating into low moans through the medication. He was in the fetal position, wrapped up, eyes closed, ears pressed against the side of his head, tail protecting his butt crack and genitals as it arced beneath him. small still silent ""Does. It. Hurt?"" the strange voice of the naked Atrekna, sounding like a badly recorded female lemur. small still silent Yrler didn't know what was happening to his body. It didn't matter. He was somewhere else now. Beyond his body. Beyond safe memories. Beyond everything to the point that nothing could truly reach him. survive escape resist evasion He was within all three. He had survived his injuries so far, had survived those razor sharp fingers rooting through his memories, his thoughts, touching his soul. He had escaped their touch, their punishments on his already battered body, their assaults upon his mind. He couldn't feel his body any longer but that was good. He had escaped beyond their reach. He was past resisting. His memories were his own, but they were disconnected, no longer attached, protected by the fact that his brain no longer processed memories, no longer made neural function calls to his long term, mid-term, or even short term or immediate memory clusters. He resisted by having escaped. small still silent He could evade them now. He was beyond them, outside their reach. Free. Candy? The memory whispered at him, a distorted female lemur voice, but it wafted past him like an ill wind and he paid it no mind. He was the bubble on the night sea, the pollen in the night air. small silent still He knew he was screaming somewhere else. Knew he was writhing in pain. But he had escaped the pain. He floated in warm blackness, curled into the fetal position. ""Peflar? Pelfar? Can you hear me?"" reverberated through the darkness. small silent still Yrler felt himself slowly rotate. Heard the faint pleasant gurgle of bubbles in dark warm water. ""Pelfar? I'm Doctor Finds the Common Ground. Can you hear me? You're in a Confederate Military Medical Center. Pelfar?"" the enemy will attempt to trick you. reject their words even if it is just simply ignoring them. listen but let the words pass through you. do not reply do not engage until you see your opportunity ""Pelfar? I'm Doctor Finds the Common Ground. I'm a psychic surgeon. I suspect you are in here. Please respond."" small silent still resist evade survive Yrler ignored it all, not even dignifying the enemy's attempt with a response, his mind blank, as he floated inside the bubble. \----- ""He's still in there,"" Finds said. ""I can't find him, but he's in there."" ""SERE training,"" the Rigellian said. She tapped the smartglass. ""He's been trained in psychic warfare counter-measures. He won't respond unless you give the correct key phrases."" ""You should give them to me so I can bring him out of it,"" Finds said. Lieutenant Colonel Gawarkrawk shook her head. ""Not yet. His brain, his thoughts, his mind was touched by a creature we know almost nothing about. It ripped apart his mind and implanted memories,"" she tapped the smartglass and brought up the image of the disfigured red-eyed Atrekna. ""Old Red-Eyes here was enraged to boot. Think about that. He had an Atrekna, arguably more skilled than even your people, root around in his brain and the Atrekna was Enraged."" LTC Gawarkrawk shifted the screen slightly to show the green mantid. ""You can try him."" \----- 515 lay on the rock, sunning himself. Around him a holoprojector was playing his favorite song. one and one is two two and two is four four and four is eight eight quacky duckies swim with four hopping frogs singing two songs in one pond warm blanket soft blanket red block is square blue triangle is blue green circle is funny He was tiny. No bigger than a credit chip. His implants were the size of grains of sand, mostly nonfunctional, the nanotech systems growing slowly with him. He could sense the spectral output of the star, taste the chemical composition of the particles on the wind, see the stresses the wind put on the stalks of purple grass beneath a violet sky. ""Five One Five! Are you in there?"" the voice asked from far away. spooky sounds are spooky but you are safe with broodmommy the song sang ""Five One Five, this is Finds the Common Ground, please respond."" 515 just ignored it, closing his eyes, turning off his antenna. warm greenie smart greenie clever greenie safe greenie The song wound around him, moved through him, lifted him beyond. He knew that part of his mind was screaming, shrieking out the equations carved into his mind by the burning razored edge of the red-eyed Atrekna's mind domination. But he was beyond that. smart greenie clever greenie one and one is two two and two is four four and four is eight The song continued as he ignored the voice. It was the enemy. An enemy trick. The red eyed Atrekna and its bizarre friends would not break him. He would not comply. He would not answer. He was 515. And he was warm and smart and clever and brave smart greenie clever greenie brave greenie \----- ""I can't reach him. He's so far down I'm not even sure he's conscious,"" Finds said. LTC Gawarkrawk noted that the gold mantid looked exhausted. ""Those equations he keeps repeating, they're branded into his psyche with a blowtorch."" ""Do we know what they are?"" LTC Gawarkrawk asked, turning to one of her aides. ""Vaguely, yes. Precisely, no,"" the Kobold said. ""Give me a gist?"" the Colonel asked. The Kobold shrugged. ""We believe a lot of it is data on the hyperatomic plane that we now know as Hellspace. There's a lot of technical data that the greenies just stare at in shock. Something about a hyperparticle energetic state non-linear accellerator or something like that,"" the Kobold gave a laugh. ""I'm a trained jumpspace and hyperspace theory scientist and those equations make my eyes cross,"" he paused. ""Another problem is, three quarters of the data is in the same language that the patient keeps mumbling."" ""Which we still don't understand,"" LTC Gawarkrawk cursed, slamming a closed fist against the smartglass. ""It's being theorized that it might be ancient Lanaktallan. From the Precursor War,"" another intelligence specialist said, this one a Pubvian. ""That's our best bet."" ""Let me guess, the Unified Council might have had spaceships from back then, but nobody speaks that old language,"" LTC Gawarkrawk snarled. ""Great. Something this important and it's a dead-end because nobody alive speaks Precursor War Lanaktallan. Nobody speaks the right language, including the advanced mathematics because of lost concepts."" There was silence for a moment. One of the women against the wall cleared her throat and took a half-step forward. Everyone turned and stared. ""That's not... necessarily true,"" the Agent said. \----- Dreams of Something More watched as the massive Herd Stallion entered her quarters. It was a glossy black biomechanical nightmare to many. Covered in sleek black armor, pistons and gears and pullies visible here and there, its feet wreathed in flame, it's six eyes burning purplish-red, it's feeding tendrils tipped with shining chrome. To the Lanaktallan, it was strength, progress, imposing and impressive. It reminded Dreams of the work of a few Terran artists. The massive black Lanaktallan nodded gravely. ""You wished to hold audience with me, Madame Diplomat?"" the huge black stallion asked, his voice cultured and smoothed, his Confederate Standard Interspecies Common Speech flawless. ""Yes,"" Dreams said. She made a motion and a starmap opened up. ""You're familiar with the current state of the Atrekna War?"" The stallion nodded. ""Operation Iron Piglet and all of its operational offensives seemed like an impossible insanity to me. The idea that the Confederacy already had all of that military might in Council Space or bordering it seemed impossible."" ""No species has ever been prepared for our war machine, whether it was the Confederacy's or the governments preceding it,"" Dreams said, nodding. ""Everyone is a gangster until the crude directional mine carrying domestic cleaning robot comes around the corner,"" the Lanakallan Herd Stallion rumbled. Dreams smiled and nodded.

post,medicalschool,"For those considering Cardiac Surgery I6 Residency Programs- Plus all my compiled Gossip about various programs.
I'm a Board Certified General Surgeon, currently in CT Fellowship.

I've mentored dozens of medical students over the years.  I've talked to many residents I6 programs, and have many friends in CT Fellowships.

This post is written for all of the medical students who are looking at I6 and General Surgery Programs, and is based off of personal opinion.  Take it for what it's worth (perhaps very little)

First off, broad generalizations:  the General Surgery-> CT fellowship pathway is long, but produces a relatively consistent product.  It has many off-ramps.  If you get 3 years in, have some kids, and decide that Cardiothoracic life is not for you, you can do breast surgery, or ACS, or hernias, or any of a million different off-ramps with differing lifestyles.  CT has far fewer off-ramps.  If you do CT, you better be committed to operating, a lot, to maintain your skills.  If your skills deteriorate, your patients WILL do worse, and this will be noticed.  No one really cares if you take an hour to do a lap chole instead of 30 minutes.  Your patient's heart cares a lot if the cross clamp time for a bypass is 2 hours instead of 1.

That said, the 2 year CT fellowships (and some 3 year...) do not truly train fellows to perform the full breadth of adult CT.  There are procedures that almost no 2 year fellowship grads and very few 3 year fellowship grads are truly qualified to do off the bat- robotic mitrals, Davids, Ross, thoracoabdominal aorta, etc.

SOME I6 programs DO get you ready to perform these rare procedures as a fresh residency grad.  Some don't.

Which brings me to the theme of I6: YMMV.  Some I6 programs are amazing.  Which stands to reason- \~4.5 years of cardiac surgery is going to make you better at cardiac than 2 years of it.  BUT, how much you do during those 4 years may be very variable, and what you graduate doing may be similar to what a traditional fellowship grad does (most programs), significantly less (if you're screwed with bad faculty), and occasionally significantly more.

CT departments are smaller than General Surgery.  The loss of 1-2 key faculty can have massive negative impacts.  The gain of 1-2 faculty who care about teaching can be massive bonuses.  For traditional CT fellowships, over 2-3 years, you can expect some stability.  Not so for I6, with 6-8 years with one department.  Good I6 programs have become trash (and to be fair, vice versa) due to this phenomenon.

With that in mind, if you're hell bent on I6, great.  But also be warned: it's growing increasingly harder to match general surgery/dual apply, as many ""high quality"" general surgery programs will not rank anyone they don't think will rank them highly/#1- which by definition includes all I6 applicants.  Only a few general surgery programs will even consider students claiming they are interested in Cardiac surgery (more will consider thoracic-interested students).

Which is another point: in general, if you are doing a lot of rotations alongside general surgery residents, that's actually a negative.  One of the smartest things Columbia and UPenn did was send their I6 residents out to community hospitals to operate.  Otherwise, they will end up being scut-monkeys on their gen surg months, since gen surg chiefs will naturally prioritize general surgery categoricals for OR opportunities.

Now, onto programs:

Columbia: solid reputation for clinical training.  Heavy work hours, but graduates come out very well trained.

Mt. Sinai: Rumor has it the graduates don't get to do much, which is sad since Mt Sinai is basically the mecca for the Ross procedure in the United States.

NYU: Same as Mt Sinai- high volume center, graduates generally dissatisfied with autonomy, but they have yet to graduate a chief- maybe it will be better once the faculty get used to training I6 residents/the chief I6 resident gets an amazing amount of autonomy their final year, which is often the case.

Brigham: Program still in shambles ever since Larry Cohn died.  Tolis has a phenomenal reputation as a teaching surgeon from MGH, but he's one guy and he doesn't let the residents do much due to objections to frequent rotations/lack of continuity with one trainee.

Maryland: Decent training.  Surprisingly more academic than Hopkins across the street- they did the first pig transplant.  Hopkins' CT program was in shambles, but is being aggressively rebuilt ironically by the guy passed over for the position of Chief at Maryland.  TBD, but I think you're trained well

Emory: Solid reputation, good training, graduates seem happy and autonomous.  Traditional fellowship (3 year) is known for being slow to give autonomy but they certainly get you there in the end.  I6 is apparently solid in terms of training.

Baylor: Legendary reputation. Middling satisfaction with training, though I6 reportedly getting a better experience than the traditional fellowship, which is on probation.

UPenn: Not as great as it used to be since Bavaria left, but perhaps it's recovered.  Used to be amazing.

Northwestern: Used to be phenomenal.  Unfortunately, a new chair took over from McCarthy, and shifted the focus from education to production, which means 3 cases/day in a room, less time for trainees to learn.

UC Davis: Not great ever since a core faculty (Victor Rodriguez) left.  Apparently solid thoracic training for what it's worth.

Stanford: Joe Woo openly states that CT surgeons are born, not made.  Which means that he will decide if you are ""trainable"" or not, and if not, he will consign you to doing TAVRs and not operating. Quite sad, given it's legendary reputation. BUT, if you're considered ""born"" to be a surgeon, you will be very well trained and handed the keys to the kingdom.

USC: Phenomenal training- significantly above what is reported by other residents nationwide.  PGY2s reportedly doing CABGs skin to skin, faculty dedicated to taking the time to train as directed by Vaughn Starnes.  That said, brutal culture and hours.  Be warned.

Ceders-Sinai: Solid training.  Chikwe put a twitter post out showing a PGY2 doing a mitral repair, which the residents there state was mostly staged/bullshit, but they are on the whole operating and learning quite well.

Cleveland Clinic: Extremely chaotic, very busy, attendings not very focused on teaching and also have an army of super-fellows.  Several residents not too happy with training, but some exceptions.

Take this for what it's worth.  Best wishes to all on figuring out what to do and where to train.

UPDATE:

From another poster:

Brigham - only recently has had i6 grads so hard to tell what the product of the i6 program is. but traditional fellows (both 4/3 and 5/2) do not seem to come out as well trained compared to some of the other options you listed (though, this is likely true of many other i6 programs where you've got both other training tracks). as you mentioned is the case for traditional training programs, they can come out able to do cabg and avr, but definitely not the more complex stuff without a fellowship. things may change now that sundt has taken over as MGB chief but hard to really tell.

columbia: chiefs graduate as excellent technical surgeons, able to do complex aortic work with zero issues. only question is heart failure because they have advanced fellows for that, but they still get plenty of experience with transplant and mcs. outstanding faculty dedicated to teaching. senior residents always on the right side of the table. also, senior residents actually have a pretty good lifestyle since they don't round on patients. no one questions whether a columbia grad can operate. huge financial support from the department since chair is a CT surgeon.

penn: disagree that it has gone massively downhill since bavaria left. yes they certainly lost volume from that, but they are still very busy with aortic work thanks to desai and some other new faculty. culture there will stay the same since szeto was trained by acker. similar to columbia, the resident is always on the right side of the table for every case. there is turnover at penn but many of their new faculty trained there so there is the same dedication to teaching. residents come out fully ready to practice in any setting.

**Planet Slatmurt - Neo-Sapient/Near Sapient Space Border**

**Two Weeks after Case Omaha**

**Three Months after Initial Red Dots in Hesstla System**

The mess hall was full of chattering, the clattering of cutlery on dishes, the clink of glasses, and here and there laughter. It was a quikbuild structure, put up by ants almost as an afterthought, a place for beings to eat and relax a little while. Treana'ad made jokes and puffed at their cigarettes underneath air circulators/filters. Mantid talked about the last drop and how it was better/worse than this one. Rigellian females talked and sang as they ate, their conversation often about the beauty of an oiled brown feather. The Telkans stared around them at everyone talking and laughing.

They were three days into a hard drop.

Task Force Angry Duck, Sixteenth Army, V CORPS (MIXED), and 1st Telkan Marine Division, First Regiment had arrived barely in time to hold off the wave after wave of Precursor metal from overwhelming the planet. Rather than leave when the math said, they kept bringing in additional waves while the previous forces retreated. They were making heavier use of drop-troops, going for the ground pound to secure victory. Space was still contested, with Task Force Angry Duck joined by Task Force Black Hammer, the latter following the Precursor vessels when they ran for it.

Ground was still anyone's game.

The world was rich in iridium and lithium, gravity well spun crystals with atmospheric doping making the material a hard sought resource.

Which meant whoever wanted it had to take it.

The Precursor Autonomous War Machines were a mix of Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III Hybrids. A nasty mix with a whole passel of tricks up their metal sleeves.

The Telkan were on their first offworld combat deployment. They were doing well, up to the standards of Confederate Space Force, their casualties low. Most of all, they knew when to call in for close air, artillery, or infantry support when things started to get dicey.

A single Telkan came into the mess hall and the rest of the Telkan went quiet. The fur on his ears, around the tip of his muzzle, around his eyes, was all silver. He walked with a limp, one eye and one ear were black warsteel replacements. The Telkan went back to eating, quietly, as the new arrival went through the chow line and got a tray of food before moving over to sit with the handful of Terran Descent Human officers sitting at the table.

Colonel Iisak nodded to the Telkan officer, who nodded back and went to clearing his tray. The human noted that the Telkan's fur had the slick plastic look of someone who had just gone through the showers to wash away hours of suit-sweat. While the Telkan was eating the other officers made small talk, mostly about the condition of their units and how well the fight was going.

Finally the Telkan officer pushed back his tray and picked up a long stalk of greenish red plant to nibble on.

""How's it look out there, Lieutenant?"" Colonel Iisak asked.

""Looks like we've got them on the run,"" The Telkan said. His voice was rough and coarse, like he'd been chewing gravel all day. ""Third Armor's rolling on drop points the AWM's are using, pushing them back to the Graveyard. My Brigade is rotating back for some R&R.""

The Colonel nodded. The Graveyard was where a dozen of the larger Precursors that were able to come into the atmosphere had landed and then had been disabled by General Trucker's heavy tanks and atomic strikes from 8th Infantry during the initial landing of V Corps. The dead AWM's were still spitting out smaller war machines, but now there was the opportunity to push them back into the Graveyard and then the Harvester Class AWM's could be handled.

""How's the weather?"" General Hwrawkar asked, setting down her glass of juice. She was in charge of a Regiment of fast attack grav-strikers and, like most pilots, almost obsessed over the weather.

""Starting to cool off. Had some bad black rain yesterday, lots of heavy metal in it,"" the Telkan said. ""Wasn't too bad on the way back.""

The Rigellian nodded, closing her eyes and bringing up her command console with her implant and ordering the mechanics to double-check the radiation shielding on all the strikers.

""How's our hosts?"" The sole one star General asked. He knew the answers his staff had given him, but it was always good to hear from another source.

Plus, the young Telkan male was a newly minted officer. Sure, he could fight, he could inspire his troops, but leadership was more than yelling battlecries and pulling the trigger.

""Still staying low,"" the Telkan said. ""It's all too much for them still.""

""Their females and young are fragile,"" Hwrawkar mused, opening her eyes. ""Something I can empathize with.""

The male Telkan nodded.

""How are your men?"" General asked, keeping his voice mild.

""Morale was a little wobbly when those city sized Harvesters landed but it's firmed back up now,"" the Telkan said. ""We've taken pretty low casualties, all things considered.""

""How are the new suits?"" Colonel Krikitaki, Ninth Maintenance Brigade, asked mildly.

""Still shaking out. The new psychic shielding makes everyone's teeth tingle,"" the Telkan said. He shook his head. ""Funny that I fought most of the Telkan Wars with bare minimum shielding.""

""Type-III's push psychic assaults harder than the other two,"" General Hwrawkar said. She tapped one black talon against the side of her glass. ""I'm just glad that you are as resistant to psychic attacks as we are. It is rare.""

The Telkan officer nodded. He finished off the stalk of vegetable and nodded to everyone. ""Gentlemen. Ladies,"" he said, standing up. He gathered his tray and went to the wash rack, clearing his tray before putting it into the shelving where it would be taken back and washed.

He thought it was funny that in an age of nantites, mass reclaimation systems, and robotics, washing pots, pans, and dishes was still done by hand in the Terran military.

Soldiers saluted as he made his way through the firebase, hastily constructed over the last two days while the Lanaktallan military forces had been refit to be able to fight next to the Terrans without the danger of the Terran weapons damaging Lanaktallan vessels by the mere act of firing.

He was walking behind a pair of Terran infantrymen, both of whom were mostly biological, when he saw it.

The three green dots at the base of their skull, subdermal LEDs that were roughly an inch wide, a quarter inch thick, with rounded ends, all flashed. The bottom went turned red, then the middle one lit up amber, followed by the top one turning amber.

""Soldiers, stand fast,"" the Telkan snapped, hurrying up to them.

The two infantrymen stopped, looking down at the Telkan officer and going to attention.

""Yes, sir?"" the one on the left asked.

""Right now, are you suffering headaches or any other strange symptoms,"" the Telkan asked.

Both of them looked at each other and then down.

""No, sir,"" they both said.

""I need you both to come with me to medical,"" the Telkan said.

""May we ask why, Lieutenant Vuxten?"" the one on the right asked after checking the Telkan's rank and nametag.

""Your SUDS telltales just went off green,"" the Telkan said. ""Come with me.""

Both men put their hands on the back of their necks and nodded.

Vuxten hurried down the passageway, stopping three times more when he saw Terrans with the same thing on their SUDS telltales.

Some soldiers were still green, some were flashing green.

Vuxten activated his comlink, tuning into the command channel.

""Base, get me medical,"" Vuxten snapped.

The comlink rang twice before it was answered.

""Captain Davis-Klikatik, 27th Med,"" a woman answered.

""Lieutenant Vuxten, 1st Telkan, I've got nine Terran soldiers with blown out SUDS,"" he waved at three other humans, stopping them. He glanced at the back of their necks. ""Twelve now. We're under attack.""

""It's happening all over base. There's a general recall for all forces not engaged with the enemy to pull back,"" the medical officer said, her voice tight with stress.

""Should I bring them into Medical?"" Vuxten asked.

""Negative. Tell them to return to their muster area,"" the doctor said. ""MedCom out.""

""Vuxten, out,"" he said. He turned to the gathered up soldiers. ""MedCom wants you to return to your barracks or muster area unless you get instructions otherwise,"" he said.

They nodded and Vuxten noted that their eyes were glowing amber. He filed the information away. He'd seen it before, during the war. Human's eyes often had a faint glow to them, but this was different.

""Yes, sir,"" they said, the small knot of them dissolving as they hurried to their garrison areas.

Vuxten tapped his comlink again.

""General Nagwark-Tambunta, 1st Telkan,"" the human voice said.

""Sir, this is Lieutenant Vuxten,"" he answered, hurrying toward the garrison area.

""What do you need, Lieutenant?"" the General asked.

""We're under attack. SUDS are going one red two amber across the entire base. Have all human members of First Telkan checked,"" Vuxten said, squeezing by a blast door that was shutting.

""Hang on,"" the General said.

Vuxten noticed that the normally laconic Terran Space Force (Marines) General sounded irritated by the entire world existing.

""You're right. Vuxten, I need you to gather up all Telkan officers and meet me in Briefing Room Seven,"" the General said. ""Don't fuck around brushing your fur, you get straight there, Marine, understood?""

""Yes, sir,"" Vuxten said.

The comlink shut off. Another surprise. Usually the General was a stickler for procedure.

He hurried faster.

\--------------------

""General Papatonis wants 3rd Armor to break contact and fall back to Log Base Tembo,"" Trucker's radioman, Sergeant Soto, called out.

Trucker spit over the side, keeping the TC's gun on the target, ripping armor from the entire side of the Precursor machine. The quad-barrel found something inside of the machine and it's side blew out even as the top bulged and shed armor.

""Tell the General we're engaged with the enemy!"" Trucker yelled out. ""Fat Boy, hit that hill, three shots! There's a crawler behind it! BOLO Muttonchop, go to rapid fire on your hellbore at this angle! Second Regiment, Third Brigade, hot cycle your indirect fire forges, dump the slush!""

He *knew* if they disengaged it would allow the flow of scrap metal flowing out of The Graveyard to overwhelm 1st Lanaktallan Armor Division through the sheer weight of numbers. It would allow the heavier machines, who had led their attack with an orbital strike into the carefully laid minefield, to break out and bypass Log Bases Tembo and Log Base Shi, which would let them flank BOLO Unit XXIX-TCSF 4721-FGY, AKA Fergy, with enough force they might be able to disable or even destroy the self-aware supertank.

His mental image of the battlefield shifted and he suddenly *knew* that elements of 528th Infantry were about to be cut off by Precursors on the other side of the hills from him. The hills were heavy in iron and granite with a river in the middle that was steaming from the heat being dumped into it by the Balor just over the curvature of the planet.

""Little Boy! Pink Pearl! Steady Lad! Fire for effect, full Shake & Bake, on these coordinates!"" Trucker shouted over his open comlink. ""Give 'em six shots of Shake & Bake then hit 'em with a scoop of Rocky Road!""

The three tanks didn't even ask questions or doublecheck, their indirect fire crew member loading the fireplan Trucker had handed them nearly a minute ago and hitting execute.

""The General is insisting,"" the commo tech yelled.

""Tell the General that we regretfully inform him that we are ENGAGED WITH THE ENEMY!"" Trucker yelled. ""All Night Long, get in tight on Black Betty, they're about to lose their APERS strip! Cherry Fairy, hit that hulk again, there's some clanker crabs in it! Butthole Surfer, cycle your main gun, your compression chamber's whistling loud enough for me to hear it all the way over here.""

Unnoticed by Trucker, or anyone else in 3rd Armor...

...the LED's flashed three times.

And went to a stack of red burning coldly beneath the skin.

\-----------------

A'armo'o watched Trucker's commands ripple through the hologram in front of him, how the battle shifted around him as if the Terran General knew what was going to happen. He watched as the General kept updating and filing fire plans that were executed sometimes up to two minutes later with devestating effect.

His Second Most High had fainted when Trucker had ordered one of the massive BOLO's riding his flanks to fire into the sky.

For a Balor to drop down out of the clouds and interference and straight into the firepower. The BOLO had gutted the Balor and it had crashed into The Graveyard.

The way Trucker orchestrated the battlefield and estimated enemy actions had proven too much for A'armo'o's second in command.

A'armo'o himself watched it with interest. His own men were engaged with the light units flowing from The Graveyard, trying to reach Log Base Hota.

""General Trucker has filed a fire and maneuver plan for your approval, Great Most High,"" the Terran Digital Sentience, a reconstruction of a famous and experience Terran armor commander by the name of Torgath informed him.

""The battle is moving too fast for me. What is your opinion?"" A'armo'o asked.

""I question parts of it, as I have, but General Trucker appears to be a gifted commander. I would recommend following it,"" Torgath said, his voice stuffy.

""Then make it so,"" A'armo'o ordered.

There was silence for a second.

""Firing point defense systems, boss! Don't know..."" T'Caw started to say.

The point defense guns opened fire just above the crest of a hill a mile away.

The Precursor striker vehicles popped over the hill just in time to run into a full barrage that tore them apart in a furious set of explosions.

""...why. Oh,"" T'Caw said. ""Trucker?""

""General Trucker,"" A'armo'o chuckled as a set of Terran strikers roared by just overhead, their guns hammering and rockets firing from beneath their stubby wings.

*This* felt like a properly run war.

\------------------------

""How are you feeling?"" the Terran female asked.

Mo'owa'alkr was proud at himself that he didn't flinch back from her. He had thought that the amber or red light from the eyes was just from their warborgs or cybernetics, but this Terran female had biological eyes and they glowed a warm amber.

""I am slightly dizzy,"" Mo'owa'alkr said.

""That's the sedative,"" she said. ""Your surgery went well.""

""Surgery?"" Mo'owa'alkr asked. The last thing he remembered was sitting in his fighting position and laughing.

""When you came in, we saw you had suffered some microstrokes. Precursor Scream exposure,"" the Terran said. ""We had to replace two of your eyes. We tried to save them, but the blood vessels had ruptured throughout the entire structure.""

""Oh,"" Mo'owa'alkr said. That explained the two black sections in his vision. He lifted up a glass. ""May I have some more juice?""

""Sure,"" The Terran smiled and Mo'owa'alkr was proud of himself for not flinching. She handed him the glass. ""There's a psych tech coming to talk to you. We're worried about shell shock or combat fatigue.""

Mo'owa'alkr nodded, feeling slightly ashamed.

""Hey, now,"" the Terran said. ""You did good for what you were facing.""

""Really?"" Mo'owa'alkr said. He felt almost desperate for her approval.

""Absolutely. You were outnumbered, outgunned, and under heavy psychic assault,"" she said. She patted his upper right arm. ""Almost three hundred of your fellow troops survived with you.""

""Oh,"" Mo'owa'alkr said quietly as the nurse left.

His Herd had been nearly five thousand strong.

It was a quikbuild structure, put up by ants almost as an afterthought, a place for beings to eat and relax a little while. Treana'ad made jokes and puffed at their cigarettes underneath air circulators/filters. Mantid talked about the last drop and how it was better/worse than this one. Rigellian females talked and sang as they ate, their conversation often about the beauty of an oiled brown feather. The Telkans stared around them at everyone talking and laughing. They were three days into a hard drop. Task Force Angry Duck, Sixteenth Army, V CORPS MIXED, and 1st Telkan Marine Division, First Regiment had arrived barely in time to hold off the wave after wave of Precursor metal from overwhelming the planet. Rather than leave when the math said, they kept bringing in additional waves while the previous forces retreated. They were making heavier use of drop-troops, going for the ground pound to secure victory. Space was still contested, with Task Force Angry Duck joined by Task Force Black Hammer, the latter following the Precursor vessels when they ran for it. Ground was still anyone's game. The world was rich in iridium and lithium, gravity well spun crystals with atmospheric doping making the material a hard sought resource. Which meant whoever wanted it had to take it. The Precursor Autonomous War Machines were a mix of Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III Hybrids. A nasty mix with a whole passel of tricks up their metal sleeves. The Telkan were on their first offworld combat deployment. They were doing well, up to the standards of Confederate Space Force, their casualties low. Most of all, they knew when to call in for close air, artillery, or infantry support when things started to get dicey. A single Telkan came into the mess hall and the rest of the Telkan went quiet. The fur on his ears, around the tip of his muzzle, around his eyes, was all silver. He walked with a limp, one eye and one ear were black warsteel replacements. The Telkan went back to eating, quietly, as the new arrival went through the chow line and got a tray of food before moving over to sit with the handful of Terran Descent Human officers sitting at the table. Colonel Iisak nodded to the Telkan officer, who nodded back and went to clearing his tray. The human noted that the Telkan's fur had the slick plastic look of someone who had just gone through the showers to wash away hours of suit-sweat. While the Telkan was eating the other officers made small talk, mostly about the condition of their units and how well the fight was going. Finally the Telkan officer pushed back his tray and picked up a long stalk of greenish red plant to nibble on. ""How's it look out there, Lieutenant?"" Colonel Iisak asked. ""Looks like we've got them on the run,"" The Telkan said. His voice was rough and coarse, like he'd been chewing gravel all day. ""Third Armor's rolling on drop points the AWM's are using, pushing them back to the Graveyard. My Brigade is rotating back for some R&R."" The Colonel nodded. The Graveyard was where a dozen of the larger Precursors that were able to come into the atmosphere had landed and then had been disabled by General Trucker's heavy tanks and atomic strikes from 8th Infantry during the initial landing of V Corps. The dead AWM's were still spitting out smaller war machines, but now there was the opportunity to push them back into the Graveyard and then the Harvester Class AWM's could be handled. ""How's the weather?"" General Hwrawkar asked, setting down her glass of juice. She was in charge of a Regiment of fast attack grav-strikers and, like most pilots, almost obsessed over the weather. ""Starting to cool off. Had some bad black rain yesterday, lots of heavy metal in it,"" the Telkan said. ""Wasn't too bad on the way back."" The Rigellian nodded, closing her eyes and bringing up her command console with her implant and ordering the mechanics to double-check the radiation shielding on all the strikers. ""How's our hosts?"" The sole one star General asked. He knew the answers his staff had given him, but it was always good to hear from another source. Plus, the young Telkan male was a newly minted officer. Sure, he could fight, he could inspire his troops, but leadership was more than yelling battlecries and pulling the trigger. ""Still staying low,"" the Telkan said. ""It's all too much for them still."" ""Their females and young are fragile,"" Hwrawkar mused, opening her eyes. ""Something I can empathize with."" The male Telkan nodded. ""How are your men?"" General asked, keeping his voice mild. ""Morale was a little wobbly when those city sized Harvesters landed but it's firmed back up now,"" the Telkan said. ""We've taken pretty low casualties, all things considered."" ""How are the new suits?"" Colonel Krikitaki, Ninth Maintenance Brigade, asked mildly. ""Still shaking out. The new psychic shielding makes everyone's teeth tingle,"" the Telkan said. He shook his head. ""Funny that I fought most of the Telkan Wars with bare minimum shielding."" ""Type-III's push psychic assaults harder than the other two,"" General Hwrawkar said. She tapped one black talon against the side of her glass. ""I'm just glad that you are as resistant to psychic attacks as we are. It is rare."" The Telkan officer nodded. He finished off the stalk of vegetable and nodded to everyone. ""Gentlemen. Ladies,"" he said, standing up. He gathered his tray and went to the wash rack, clearing his tray before putting it into the shelving where it would be taken back and washed. He thought it was funny that in an age of nantites, mass reclaimation systems, and robotics, washing pots, pans, and dishes was still done by hand in the Terran military. Soldiers saluted as he made his way through the firebase, hastily constructed over the last two days while the Lanaktallan military forces had been refit to be able to fight next to the Terrans without the danger of the Terran weapons damaging Lanaktallan vessels by the mere act of firing. He was walking behind a pair of Terran infantrymen, both of whom were mostly biological, when he saw it. The three green dots at the base of their skull, subdermal LEDs that were roughly an inch wide, a quarter inch thick, with rounded ends, all flashed. The bottom went turned red, then the middle one lit up amber, followed by the top one turning amber. ""Soldiers, stand fast,"" the Telkan snapped, hurrying up to them. The two infantrymen stopped, looking down at the Telkan officer and going to attention. ""Yes, sir?"" the one on the left asked. ""Right now, are you suffering headaches or any other strange symptoms,"" the Telkan asked. Both of them looked at each other and then down. ""No, sir,"" they both said. ""I need you both to come with me to medical,"" the Telkan said. ""May we ask why, Lieutenant Vuxten?"" the one on the right asked after checking the Telkan's rank and nametag. ""Your SUDS telltales just went off green,"" the Telkan said. ""Come with me."" Both men put their hands on the back of their necks and nodded. Vuxten hurried down the passageway, stopping three times more when he saw Terrans with the same thing on their SUDS telltales. Some soldiers were still green, some were flashing green. Vuxten activated his comlink, tuning into the command channel. ""Base, get me medical,"" Vuxten snapped. The comlink rang twice before it was answered. ""Captain Davis-Klikatik, 27th Med,"" a woman answered. ""Lieutenant Vuxten, 1st Telkan, I've got nine Terran soldiers with blown out SUDS,"" he waved at three other humans, stopping them. He glanced at the back of their necks. ""Twelve now. We're under attack."" ""It's happening all over base. There's a general recall for all forces not engaged with the enemy to pull back,"" the medical officer said, her voice tight with stress. ""Should I bring them into Medical?"" Vuxten asked. ""Negative. Tell them to return to their muster area,"" the doctor said. ""MedCom out."" ""Vuxten, out,"" he said. He turned to the gathered up soldiers. ""MedCom wants you to return to your barracks or muster area unless you get instructions otherwise,"" he said. They nodded and Vuxten noted that their eyes were glowing amber. He filed the information away. He'd seen it before, during the war. Human's eyes often had a faint glow to them, but this was different. ""Yes, sir,"" they said, the small knot of them dissolving as they hurried to their garrison areas. Vuxten tapped his comlink again. ""General Nagwark-Tambunta, 1st Telkan,"" the human voice said. ""Sir, this is Lieutenant Vuxten,"" he answered, hurrying toward the garrison area. ""What do you need, Lieutenant?"" the General asked. ""We're under attack. SUDS are going one red two amber across the entire base. Have all human members of First Telkan checked,"" Vuxten said, squeezing by a blast door that was shutting. ""Hang on,"" the General said. Vuxten noticed that the normally laconic Terran Space Force Marines General sounded irritated by the entire world existing. ""You're right. Vuxten, I need you to gather up all Telkan officers and meet me in Briefing Room Seven,"" the General said. ""Don't fuck around brushing your fur, you get straight there, Marine, understood?"" ""Yes, sir,"" Vuxten said. The comlink shut off. Another surprise. Usually the General was a stickler for procedure. He hurried faster. \-------------------- ""General Papatonis wants 3rd Armor to break contact and fall back to Log Base Tembo,"" Trucker's radioman, Sergeant Soto, called out. Trucker spit over the side, keeping the TC's gun on the target, ripping armor from the entire side of the Precursor machine. The quad-barrel found something inside of the machine and it's side blew out even as the top bulged and shed armor. ""Tell the General we're engaged with the enemy!"" Trucker yelled out. ""Fat Boy, hit that hill, three shots! There's a crawler behind it! BOLO Muttonchop, go to rapid fire on your hellbore at this angle! Second Regiment, Third Brigade, hot cycle your indirect fire forges, dump the slush!"" He knew if they disengaged it would allow the flow of scrap metal flowing out of The Graveyard to overwhelm 1st Lanaktallan Armor Division through the sheer weight of numbers. It would allow the heavier machines, who had led their attack with an orbital strike into the carefully laid minefield, to break out and bypass Log Bases Tembo and Log Base Shi, which would let them flank BOLO Unit XXIX-TCSF 4721-FGY, AKA Fergy, with enough force they might be able to disable or even destroy the self-aware supertank. His mental image of the battlefield shifted and he suddenly knew that elements of 528th Infantry were about to be cut off by Precursors on the other side of the hills from him. The hills were heavy in iron and granite with a river in the middle that was steaming from the heat being dumped into it by the Balor just over the curvature of the planet. ""Little Boy! Pink Pearl! Steady Lad! Fire for effect, full Shake & Bake, on these coordinates!"" Trucker shouted over his open comlink. ""Give 'em six shots of Shake & Bake then hit 'em with a scoop of Rocky Road!"" The three tanks didn't even ask questions or doublecheck, their indirect fire crew member loading the fireplan Trucker had handed them nearly a minute ago and hitting execute. ""The General is insisting,"" the commo tech yelled. ""Tell the General that we regretfully inform him that we are ENGAGED WITH THE ENEMY!"" Trucker yelled. ""All Night Long, get in tight on Black Betty, they're about to lose their APERS strip! Cherry Fairy, hit that hulk again, there's some clanker crabs in it! Butthole Surfer, cycle your main gun, your compression chamber's whistling loud enough for me to hear it all the way over here."" Unnoticed by Trucker, or anyone else in 3rd Armor... ...the LED's flashed three times. And went to a stack of red burning coldly beneath the skin. \----------------- A'armo'o watched Trucker's commands ripple through the hologram in front of him, how the battle shifted around him as if the Terran General knew what was going to happen. He watched as the General kept updating and filing fire plans that were executed sometimes up to two minutes later with devestating effect. His Second Most High had fainted when Trucker had ordered one of the massive BOLO's riding his flanks to fire into the sky. For a Balor to drop down out of the clouds and interference and straight into the firepower. The BOLO had gutted the Balor and it had crashed into The Graveyard. The way Trucker orchestrated the battlefield and estimated enemy actions had proven too much for A'armo'o's second in command. A'armo'o himself watched it with interest. His own men were engaged with the light units flowing from The Graveyard, trying to reach Log Base Hota. ""General Trucker has filed a fire and maneuver plan for your approval, Great Most High,"" the Terran Digital Sentience, a reconstruction of a famous and experience Terran armor commander by the name of Torgath informed him. ""The battle is moving too fast for me. What is your opinion?"" A'armo'o asked. ""I question parts of it, as I have, but General Trucker appears to be a gifted commander. I would recommend following it,"" Torgath said, his voice stuffy. ""Then make it so,"" A'armo'o ordered. There was silence for a second. ""Firing point defense systems, boss! Don't know..."" T'Caw started to say. The point defense guns opened fire just above the crest of a hill a mile away.

post,RobotRenaissance,"Exploring the Ethics of Autonomous Robots.
Robotics is revolutionizing healthcare, offering innovative solutions to complex medical challenges. Surgical robots, for example, are transforming surgeries with greater precision and improved outcomes. They perform minimally invasive procedures with smaller incisions, leading to reduced pain, shorter recovery times, and fewer complications.

Rehabilitation also benefits from robotics, with robotic exoskeletons helping patients regain mobility after injuries or strokes. These wearable robots assist with walking and movement, providing support and feedback for improved strength and coordination.

Beyond surgery and rehabilitation, robots aid in medication delivery, patient monitoring, and eldercare. While the benefits are clear, challenges include cost, integration, and ensuring patient safety and privacy. Despite these, the future of healthcare robotics looks promising, with continued advancements set to transform the industry further.

**Ethics: Exploring the Ethics of Autonomous Robots**

The rise of autonomous robots, such as vehicles and drones, raises important ethical questions. One key issue is accountability in accidents: who is responsible, the manufacturer, the programmer, or the robot itself?

Another concern is the decision-making algorithms used by autonomous robots. How do we ensure these decisions are ethical, especially in dilemmas like saving pedestrians versus vehicle occupants?

There are also concerns about the societal impact, such as job loss due to autonomous vehicles. Ensuring fair distribution of benefits and minimizing harm to certain groups is essential.

post,lazerpig,"Israel vs The Narrative
Probably I'll be downvoted to hell but screw it. It is what it is.

I've seen some replies to my posts lately, accusing Israel of being a war criminal and the root of all global issues while relying on ICC, ICJ, and B'tselem. These claims are not just misleading; they're absurd. Let's break this down rationally, starting with some context.

# October 7, 2023

Hamas launched an unprovoked and brutal attack on Israel, killing over 1,400 civilians in one day. Families, children, and ordinary people were massacred or kidnapped. The October 7 attack wasn't an act of resistance; it was pure terrorism. Israel responded, and soon after, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen joined the fray. Let's be clear: Israel did not provoke them. These groups act as proxies for Iran, destabilizing the region under the guise of defending Palestine.

# ICC and ICJ

* Let's talk about the role of international organizations like the ICC (International Criminal Court) and ICJ (International Court of Justice) in perpetuating biased narratives against Israel. The ICC claims jurisdiction over Israel based on recognizing Palestine as a state, even though this recognition is far from universal, and Israel isn't a member of the court. Meanwhile, nations like Saudi Arabia, China, and Russia escape scrutiny despite significant human rights abuses because of their power and influence.
* The ICJ, often used as a political tool, accepts referrals from nations with questionable motives. For example, resolutions against Israel are often pushed by countries like Iran and Pakistan, regimes with abysmal human rights records of their own. This selective targeting raises questions about the bias of these bodies.

While Israel's actions are scrutinized under a global microscope, the actual atrocities in places like Syria, China, and Yemen are ignored. This inconsistency highlights the politicized nature of these institutions, undermining their credibility and objectivity.

# What About B'Tselem?

Some Redditors quote the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem to support their claims against Israel. Here's the thing: B'Tselem is an ultra-left outlet that freely criticizes the Israeli government. Whether or not you agree with their perspective, their existence speaks volumes about Israel's openness and democracy. Think about it: Could such an organization operate freely in China, Saudi Arabia, or Iran, where dissenters are jailed or executed? The fact that B'Tselem can openly challenge Israel's policies shows that the Israeli press and society investigate and debate its actions, a hallmark of a progressive and democratic society.

# The Hypocrisy of Calling Israel the Problem

It's almost laughable to call Israel the main problem in the Middle East while ignoring what's happening elsewhere:

* China detains and kills over a million Uyghur Muslims in camps and suppresses pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong. Activists are jailed or silenced, but hey, they make your phones and TVs, so there are no ICC investigations here.
* Saudi Arabia has turned Yemen into a humanitarian disaster and assassinated a Saudi critic journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, in a consulate. Yet, it faces no significant repercussions because money talks.
* Syria, with the help of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, has killed over half a million people using chemical weapons and barrel bombs. Entire towns are rubble, and millions are displaced, but there is no accountability.
* Iran brutally oppresses minorities, executes protesters, and violently suppresses women's rights activists. Yet, somehow, it's still seen as credible enough to lecture others on justice and human rights.
* Palestinian Territories, governed by Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, are rife with human rights abuses against their people. Arbitrary arrests, suppression of protests, and crackdowns on dissent are routine. Women, minorities, and political opponents often suffer the most, but these violations rarely make headlines.
* Oh, and by the way, LGBT rights are non-existent in any of these countries; if you are gay, you either go to jail or be murdered.

# The Genocide Claim

The accusation that Israel is committing genocide is not only false but a distortion of the term. Genocide refers to the deliberate and systematic extermination of a people. In contrast:

* Population Growth: The Palestinian population in both Gaza and the West Bank has been steadily increasing. This alone contradicts any claim of genocide, as populations subjected to genocide do not grow; they diminish.
* Humanitarian Measures: Despite ongoing conflict, Israel provides humanitarian aid to Gaza, including medical supplies and electricity. Israel also treats Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, even during times of heightened tensions.
* Military Objectives, Not Ethnic Cleansing: Israel's military actions target Hamas, a terrorist organization that uses civilians as human shields rather than Palestinian civilians as a group. Precision targeting and efforts to warn civilians before strikes further demonstrate that Israel's actions are not aimed at extermination but at defense.

If Israel were truly committing genocide, you wouldn't see the kind of growth and international aid provided to Palestinian territories that exists today. This accusation diminishes the weight of actual genocides, such as those seen in Rwanda or Bosnia, by misusing the term.

# The Apartheid Claim

Calling Israel an apartheid state oversimplifies a complex situation. Arab citizens of Israel vote, serve in parliament, become judges, and have the same rights as Jews and other ethnicities and religions. Compare this to apartheid South Africa, where Black citizens were denied every fundamental right. The West Bank situation is challenging, but the apartheid label ignores decades of nuanced conflict.

# What Israel Brings to the World

While people scream ""Israel bad,"" they conveniently overlook Israel's contributions:

* Tech? Israel revolutionized healthcare with Mazor Robotics for spinal surgeries and leads in autonomous driving with Mobileye.
* Medicine? Breakthroughs like Exelon for Alzheimer's and cancer immunotherapy are saving lives globally. Israel's advancements in regenerative medicine, such as lab-grown organs, are shaping the future.
* Humanitarian Aid? Israeli disaster response teams, like those deployed after earthquakes in Turkey, save countless lives with cutting-edge equipment and expertise. They prioritize humanity, even aiding nations that deny diplomatic ties.

# The Bigger Picture

No country is perfect, not Israel, not any other one. Israel suffers from some levels of systemic corruption, and there is a huge divide internally on a lot of topics, especially on judiciary reforms and the lack of political stability; there is a lot to improve. But singling out Israel as the villain of the Middle East while giving a free pass to regimes like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and China is hypocritical.

The evening was warm, with a comfortable breeze that carried the scent of flowers across the lawn. Festivity lights were scattered about, providing decoration to the lawn. The fountain, which had borne silent witness to many plots, burbled as the water cascaded down, lit by different color lights to produce a pleasing effect.

The music was soft, tinkling, a comfortable counterpoint to the conversations, even though the majority of guests weren't used to music at all.

The guests mingled, many of them slowly overcoming their anxiety at the presence of the minority of guests. They trotted about the lawn, sipping at expensive wines and champagnes, nibbling on delicacies, the lawn comfortable beneath their hooves. Their sashes were ornamented, their vests expensive, their flank coverings lavish. The females wore jewelry that sparkled and glittered. The males wore their badges of rank and office.

Mingling through the crowd were the newcomers. Bipedal with only two arms, only two eyes, only facial hair adorning their flat faces. They were large, dense bone and muscle from evolving on a high gravity world, their two eyes forward facing and as intent as any predator's stare, made moreso by the intellect that shown in their eyes. Their mouths were full of meat tearing and plant grinding teeth, silent testimony that to them, anything that fit in their mouth was food. Their hands were strong, with firm, almost painful, grips. They were capable of grip strength to allow them to hold their entire body weight with their hands, and their arms were powerful enough to allow them to lift themselves up by their strong hands. Their legs were thick and muscled, power and endurance built into the muscle structure.

The majority, a four legged herbivore race, were very aware of the predators in their midst.

It was more than their physique. Their intellect was sharp, penetrating, and deductive. Many of the majority were surprised by the predator's ability to hold intelligent conversations on esoteric topics, from corporate profit margins to manufacturing techniques to military theory to philosophy and political thought.

The longer the party went on, the more nervous some became.

Not just because of the predators. They were enough to cause anxiety.

No, it was the host of the party, who stood with the primate predators, often laughing at their jokes, holding intricate conversations with them, and seemingly perfectly at ease with them.

They knew the System Most High was different.

Now they could see that he was not only different, he was their superior in every way.

From the way he treated the elderly party guests, to the way he paid attention to the children who he had insisted be allowed to attend, to the way he treated the primates. The party itself was lavish, an outward sign of his power even though he was in exile, but his attitude was less that of a conquered leader and more of a temporarily displaced noble.

The Lanaktallan at the party were in awe of their host.

Mana'aktoo slapped the Terran female on the back as he laughed at her joke. It was a dirty, profane joke, that had left several other Lanaktallan wide eyed with shock. The punchline of ""That's not my 256 pin superconductor connector!"" had been expected but still amusing to Mana'aktoo as well as the four representatives from the two local xenospecies, all of whom enjoyed a good earthy joke.

Making his apologies, Mana'aktoo trotted away from the low ranking grav-striker mechanic and wound his way through the party-goers, slowly making his way toward Admiral Schmidt. He knew that many high ranking officials, politicians, and hanger-ons disliked his insistence that low ranking beings be invited to his parties and treated well, but the two species that made up the majority of the system's population largely worked in factories, mines, and industrial centers.

They also loved ironic juxtaposition and earthy jokes.

As far as Mana'aktoo was concerned, nearly every being at the party with any ranking could be used for reactor mass and it would only improve the function of the system.

The Admiral was laughing at the joke about the bliss seeking meditative and the out of control ore hauler that had just been told by the Maktanan mining union leader.

Mana'aktoo had heard the joke before and found the fact that, for all of the meditative's claims of being above the physical world and material objects, the out of control ore hauler had crushed the being to death, to be sensibly amusing.

*A jocular way of reminding one another that we all live in the physical world despite our lofty claims,* Mana'aktoo thought to himself.

""Ah, Most High,"" the Maktanan said, bowing.

""Former Most High,"" Mana'aktoo corrected gently.

""Bah, that is polite fiction, even the illustrious Admiral would acknowledge that fact,"" the union boss chuckled, smoothing one ear. ""You are the leader that the Maktanan people desire. Even the Carikan have made their desire to allow you to continue your rule known to the Terrans.""

""I am honored and humbled,"" Mana'aktoo said, pressing his four hands together.

""Well, on that note, if you two high ranking beings will excuse me,"" the union boss said, making a motion toward a richly dressed female Maktanan. ""My wife wishes I attend to her wants and desires.""

""Of course,"" the Admiral said, nodding.

""Give your wife my admiration regarding her exquisite jewelry,"" Mana'aktoo said.

The union boss gave a pleased flick of his ears and hustled away.

""Your mother is looking well,"" Admiral Schmidt said, nodding toward where Mana'aktoo's mother was obviously enjoying herself talking to several female Space Force officers. ""I am gladdened to hear of her full recovery.""

""I thank you,"" Mana'aktoo answered.

His mother had developed a twisted intestine. While the Lanaktallan doctors wanted to do robotic assisted surgery the Terran Space Force had offered Mana'aktoo's mother the services of their own medical professionals.

The surgery had been entirely non-invasive. An injection of medical robots, all of them extremely tiny, two hours, and his mother had trotted out of the clinic exclaiming how she had hardly felt any discomfort.

""You mother choosing to use our medical facilities has eased a lot of anxiety toward our medical services,"" Schmidt said.

""Many of my people fear that you will treat them how they would treat you should the situation be reversed,"" Mana'aktoo said. ""Not the Maktanan or Carikan, they have much in common with your people.""

Schmidt made a non-committal noise, nodding slowly. The Admiral held up two fingers in a wait motion even though Mana'aktoo had recognized the expression on the Admiral's face. He knew it meant that the Admiral was processing a large amount of information through his implant.

Mana'aktoo felt a small shiver of concern but suppressed it, knowing that others were watching.

The Admiral blinked rapidly, turning to face Mana'aktoo, and again Mana'aktoo felt a slight bit of anxiety at the way the Terran's eyes glowed a soft amber.

They always had, but it had become more and more obvious even to the most unobservant over the last few months.

""Where is Most High Kulamu'u?"" the Admiral asked.

""His father became confused a little while ago, mistaking this gala for his retirement ceremony,"" Mana'aktoo said. ""Most High Kulamu'u took him home so he would be less agitated and confused.""

The Admiral nodded. ""Is his Second Most High present?""

Mana'aktoo nodded, pinging the Second Most High Plu'umo'o, letting the other Lanaktallan know he should present himself with all due haste.

""What is the situation?"" Mana'aktoo asked.

""Task Force Agwu just came in-system,"" Admiral Schmidt said. ""They've got casualties.""

Mana'aktoo frowned. The idea of another force inflicting casualties on the Terran Space Force seemed almost impossible. ""Who attacked them?""

""We should discuss this in private,"" Schmidt said. He looked at Mana'aktoo. ""This involves this system. As the Maktana and Carikan have made it plain they want you in charge, while you may be the Most High in Exile, you still wield enormous influence on the system.""

""I will meet you in my office,"" Mana'aktoo said. He sent a quick datalink message to his manservant to meet the Admiral at the double-doors and escort the Terran and his two bodyguards to Mana'aktoo's office.

Second Most High Plu'umo'o, commander of the system's military forces and one of Mana'aktoo's co-conspirators, came trotting up.

""Go with the Admiral. There is a situation,"" Mana'aktoo ordered.

The Second Most High saluted, trotting after the Admiral.

Mana'aktoo went looking for the two people he wanted to include. Shonvlin, the Maktana leader, and Sheechilk, the Carikan leader. Both had been put forward by their respective species to act as liaisons to the Terran Space Force, which held the system under martial law.

The two leaders followed Mana'aktoo with no argument, quickly excusing themselves from the conversations they were holding.

Mana'aktoo arrived in his office to see the Space Force Admiral standing by the desk, apparently looking out the window, but Mana'aktoo could see the red telltales on the side of the Admiral's datalink.

The Admiral was quite busy.

Mana'aktoo trotted behind his desk, sitting down and waiting for the arm rests and back rest to swing into position. Once it had he waited, bringing up the holoterminal in the middle of the room.

Finally the Admiral turned and faced everyone.

""Task Force Agwu was patrolling two of the systems nearby when they came under heavy attack by an overwhelming force of the new Precursor Autonomous War Machines,"" the Admiral said. ""They broke action twice, performing a fighting retreat.""

Everyone nodded. That was only logical, seeing as the Precursor AWM's were a fearsome opponent.

""Both times the clankers followed them, forcing them into action at the third location, which was between stellar masses,"" the Admiral said. He tossed up a hologram of the size of the Task Force.

Mana'aktoo didn't consider himself a military genius, but he had educated himself to the realities of the Terran military.

Eight carriers, twelve super-heavy warships, nearly a hundred attendant vessels, fifteen troop ships, two repair and refit ships.

One carrier was gone, two of the super-heavy, three of the troop ships, and sixteen of the attendant vessels.

""In return, Task Force Agwu managed to inflict serious casualties on the Precursors,"" The Admiral said.

Mana'aktoo looked at the numbers. For every Terran ship destroyed, they'd destroyed thirty-six point two two six of the Precursor ships.

""How many are expected to arrive?"" Mana'aktoo asked.

The Admiral nodded. ""They were heading this way already,"" the Admiral said. ""Task Force Agwu bought us a few days and are able to warn us of what would have been a significant ambush.""

Mana'aktoo could feel Plu'umo'o's tension and underlying anxiety.

""How many of them are coming?"" Mana'aktoo asked.

The Admiral tossed the force makeup of the Precursors into the holotank in the middle of the room.

Mana'aktoo stared at the numbers. He nodded slowly, realizing what he was seeing. He turned to Plu'umo'o slowly.

""With the Terran's permission, recall the troops,"" he stated. ""Prepare the shelters, coordinate with Civil Defense.""

""You have my permission to defend your world,"" the Admiral said. He stared at the holotank. ""Task Force Anvil is going to have its hands full.""

""We will stop them here. They will go no further, and they will kill no more,"" Mana'aktoo said, staring at the numbers. ""We stand against them.""

He turned and looked at the others.

""Together.""

In the middle of the room the enemy force estimates burned in cold amber light.

Festivity lights were scattered about, providing decoration to the lawn. The fountain, which had borne silent witness to many plots, burbled as the water cascaded down, lit by different color lights to produce a pleasing effect. The music was soft, tinkling, a comfortable counterpoint to the conversations, even though the majority of guests weren't used to music at all. The guests mingled, many of them slowly overcoming their anxiety at the presence of the minority of guests. They trotted about the lawn, sipping at expensive wines and champagnes, nibbling on delicacies, the lawn comfortable beneath their hooves. Their sashes were ornamented, their vests expensive, their flank coverings lavish. The females wore jewelry that sparkled and glittered. The males wore their badges of rank and office. Mingling through the crowd were the newcomers. Bipedal with only two arms, only two eyes, only facial hair adorning their flat faces. They were large, dense bone and muscle from evolving on a high gravity world, their two eyes forward facing and as intent as any predator's stare, made moreso by the intellect that shown in their eyes. Their mouths were full of meat tearing and plant grinding teeth, silent testimony that to them, anything that fit in their mouth was food. Their hands were strong, with firm, almost painful, grips. They were capable of grip strength to allow them to hold their entire body weight with their hands, and their arms were powerful enough to allow them to lift themselves up by their strong hands. Their legs were thick and muscled, power and endurance built into the muscle structure. The majority, a four legged herbivore race, were very aware of the predators in their midst. It was more than their physique. Their intellect was sharp, penetrating, and deductive. Many of the majority were surprised by the predator's ability to hold intelligent conversations on esoteric topics, from corporate profit margins to manufacturing techniques to military theory to philosophy and political thought. The longer the party went on, the more nervous some became. Not just because of the predators. They were enough to cause anxiety. No, it was the host of the party, who stood with the primate predators, often laughing at their jokes, holding intricate conversations with them, and seemingly perfectly at ease with them. They knew the System Most High was different. Now they could see that he was not only different, he was their superior in every way. From the way he treated the elderly party guests, to the way he paid attention to the children who he had insisted be allowed to attend, to the way he treated the primates. The party itself was lavish, an outward sign of his power even though he was in exile, but his attitude was less that of a conquered leader and more of a temporarily displaced noble. The Lanaktallan at the party were in awe of their host. Mana'aktoo slapped the Terran female on the back as he laughed at her joke. It was a dirty, profane joke, that had left several other Lanaktallan wide eyed with shock. The punchline of ""That's not my 256 pin superconductor connector!"" had been expected but still amusing to Mana'aktoo as well as the four representatives from the two local xenospecies, all of whom enjoyed a good earthy joke. Making his apologies, Mana'aktoo trotted away from the low ranking grav-striker mechanic and wound his way through the party-goers, slowly making his way toward Admiral Schmidt. He knew that many high ranking officials, politicians, and hanger-ons disliked his insistence that low ranking beings be invited to his parties and treated well, but the two species that made up the majority of the system's population largely worked in factories, mines, and industrial centers. They also loved ironic juxtaposition and earthy jokes. As far as Mana'aktoo was concerned, nearly every being at the party with any ranking could be used for reactor mass and it would only improve the function of the system. The Admiral was laughing at the joke about the bliss seeking meditative and the out of control ore hauler that had just been told by the Maktanan mining union leader. Mana'aktoo had heard the joke before and found the fact that, for all of the meditative's claims of being above the physical world and material objects, the out of control ore hauler had crushed the being to death, to be sensibly amusing. A jocular way of reminding one another that we all live in the physical world despite our lofty claims, Mana'aktoo thought to himself. ""Ah, Most High,"" the Maktanan said, bowing. ""Former Most High,"" Mana'aktoo corrected gently. ""Bah, that is polite fiction, even the illustrious Admiral would acknowledge that fact,"" the union boss chuckled, smoothing one ear. ""You are the leader that the Maktanan people desire. Even the Carikan have made their desire to allow you to continue your rule known to the Terrans."" ""I am honored and humbled,"" Mana'aktoo said, pressing his four hands together. ""Well, on that note, if you two high ranking beings will excuse me,"" the union boss said, making a motion toward a richly dressed female Maktanan. ""My wife wishes I attend to her wants and desires."" ""Of course,"" the Admiral said, nodding. ""Give your wife my admiration regarding her exquisite jewelry,"" Mana'aktoo said. The union boss gave a pleased flick of his ears and hustled away. ""Your mother is looking well,"" Admiral Schmidt said, nodding toward where Mana'aktoo's mother was obviously enjoying herself talking to several female Space Force officers. ""I am gladdened to hear of her full recovery."" ""I thank you,"" Mana'aktoo answered. His mother had developed a twisted intestine. While the Lanaktallan doctors wanted to do robotic assisted surgery the Terran Space Force had offered Mana'aktoo's mother the services of their own medical professionals. The surgery had been entirely non-invasive. An injection of medical robots, all of them extremely tiny, two hours, and his mother had trotted out of the clinic exclaiming how she had hardly felt any discomfort. ""You mother choosing to use our medical facilities has eased a lot of anxiety toward our medical services,"" Schmidt said. ""Many of my people fear that you will treat them how they would treat you should the situation be reversed,"" Mana'aktoo said. ""Not the Maktanan or Carikan, they have much in common with your people."" Schmidt made a non-committal noise, nodding slowly. The Admiral held up two fingers in a wait motion even though Mana'aktoo had recognized the expression on the Admiral's face. He knew it meant that the Admiral was processing a large amount of information through his implant. Mana'aktoo felt a small shiver of concern but suppressed it, knowing that others were watching. The Admiral blinked rapidly, turning to face Mana'aktoo, and again Mana'aktoo felt a slight bit of anxiety at the way the Terran's eyes glowed a soft amber. They always had, but it had become more and more obvious even to the most unobservant over the last few months. ""Where is Most High Kulamu'u?"" the Admiral asked. ""His father became confused a little while ago, mistaking this gala for his retirement ceremony,"" Mana'aktoo said. ""Most High Kulamu'u took him home so he would be less agitated and confused."" The Admiral nodded. ""Is his Second Most High present?"" Mana'aktoo nodded, pinging the Second Most High Plu'umo'o, letting the other Lanaktallan know he should present himself with all due haste. ""What is the situation?"" Mana'aktoo asked. ""Task Force Agwu just came in-system,"" Admiral Schmidt said. ""They've got casualties."" Mana'aktoo frowned. The idea of another force inflicting casualties on the Terran Space Force seemed almost impossible. ""Who attacked them?"" ""We should discuss this in private,"" Schmidt said. He looked at Mana'aktoo. ""This involves this system. As the Maktana and Carikan have made it plain they want you in charge, while you may be the Most High in Exile, you still wield enormous influence on the system."" ""I will meet you in my office,"" Mana'aktoo said. He sent a quick datalink message to his manservant to meet the Admiral at the double-doors and escort the Terran and his two bodyguards to Mana'aktoo's office. Second Most High Plu'umo'o, commander of the system's military forces and one of Mana'aktoo's co-conspirators, came trotting up. ""Go with the Admiral. There is a situation,"" Mana'aktoo ordered. The Second Most High saluted, trotting after the Admiral. Mana'aktoo went looking for the two people he wanted to include. Shonvlin, the Maktana leader, and Sheechilk, the Carikan leader. Both had been put forward by their respective species to act as liaisons to the Terran Space Force, which held the system under martial law. The two leaders followed Mana'aktoo with no argument, quickly excusing themselves from the conversations they were holding. Mana'aktoo arrived in his office to see the Space Force Admiral standing by the desk, apparently looking out the window, but Mana'aktoo could see the red telltales on the side of the Admiral's datalink. The Admiral was quite busy. Mana'aktoo trotted behind his desk, sitting down and waiting for the arm rests and back rest to swing into position. Once it had he waited, bringing up the holoterminal in the middle of the room. Finally the Admiral turned and faced everyone. ""Task Force Agwu was patrolling two of the systems nearby when they came under heavy attack by an overwhelming force of the new Precursor Autonomous War Machines,"" the Admiral said. ""They broke action twice, performing a fighting retreat."" Everyone nodded. That was only logical, seeing as the Precursor AWM's were a fearsome opponent. ""Both times the clankers followed them, forcing them into action at the third location, which was between stellar masses,"" the Admiral said. He tossed up a hologram of the size of the Task Force. Mana'aktoo didn't consider himself a military genius, but he had educated himself to the realities of the Terran military. Eight carriers, twelve super-heavy warships, nearly a hundred attendant vessels, fifteen troop ships, two repair and refit ships. One carrier was gone, two of the super-heavy, three of the troop ships, and sixteen of the attendant vessels. ""In return, Task Force Agwu managed to inflict serious casualties on the Precursors,"" The Admiral said. Mana'aktoo looked at the numbers. For every Terran ship destroyed, they'd destroyed thirty-six point two two six of the Precursor ships. ""How many are expected to arrive?"" Mana'aktoo asked. The Admiral nodded. ""They were heading this way already,"" the Admiral said. ""Task Force Agwu bought us a few days and are able to warn us of what would have been a significant ambush."" Mana'aktoo could feel Plu'umo'o's tension and underlying anxiety. ""How many of them are coming?"" Mana'aktoo asked. The Admiral tossed the force makeup of the Precursors into the holotank in the middle of the room. Mana'aktoo stared at the numbers. He nodded slowly, realizing what he was seeing. He turned to Plu'umo'o slowly. ""With the Terran's permission, recall the troops,"" he stated. ""Prepare the shelters, coordinate with Civil Defense."" ""You have my permission to defend your world,"" the Admiral said. He stared at the holotank. ""Task Force Anvil is going to have its hands full."" ""We will stop them here. They will go no further, and they will kill no more,"" Mana'aktoo said, staring at the numbers. ""We stand against them."" He turned and looked at the others. ""Together.""

**Memory Transcription Subject:** ***Elias Meier, Former UN Secretary-General***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: July 21, 2160*

Virnt paced on the sidewalk as we approached Kuemper’s convoy, lifting a segmented leg to wave farewell. He appeared to be on a holopad call, so I returned the gesture without saying a word. The Tilfish scientist was under a lot of scrutiny, after his leadership of the memory transcript project led to reviving me. There was additional pressure to extend the uploading capabilities beyond humans, though neuroscience from an Earth-based company was most advanced with our own kind. Legislators were keen to get involved, despite the fact that Austrian authorities and the UN had been apprised ahead of time. I intended to weigh in on that when the Sapient Coalition called, but securing aid for the war was a higher priority. Even synthetic bodies couldn't survive antimatter bombs; this endangered every being in our space.

“As I was saying, there’s been a vast uptick in the number of people participating in memory transcripts, ever since we announced Meier’s success. It’s insurance against death!” Virnt gushed to the person on the other end of the phone. “More machines are getting installed…some in public places. Everyone will be able to be reborn after death! It needs to be in every hospital, so we can scan anyone who passes through the doors or dies on the operating table.”

I turned to face Kuemper, as she slid into the back of the vehicle. “Is that what you’d want, if something happened to you now?”

“Yes. My specific consciousness would still end, granted, but a part of me would live on and get to see the future,” she answered. “I had a scan a few years ago. I plan to update my memories every so often, so they can restore me as I was.”

The Tilfish continued jabbering into the line. “Elias has been quite successful. He is truly immortal so long as our servers and data survive! If something happens, we have his program exactly as it was—it can be restored. I know he’s had his struggles, but I’m planning to swap out his eyes this week. It’ll be no different than surgery; go to sleep, wake up with modifications.”

I hesitated to close the car door. “*What* are you doing to my eyes?!”

“You wanted eyelids, so I’m going to give them to you. I’ll tell you later! Anyhow, as I was saying, we’re working to improve the sensory suites. Taste and smell are tricky. Proprioception, equilibrium, and motion detection are easier to fine-tune; they’re a bit rudimentary now. Humans are complicated and have a thousand chain reactions to different environments. I’d like Elias to test out things like…swimming underwater, standing on one leg, or typing with his eyes closed once we give him eyelids.”

*I’m learning new fears. I don’t want to hear any more of this conversation.*

“Start the car,” I grumbled, shutting the door. “Please. Covering my ears doesn’t work that well, and he’s talking pretty loud.”

Virnt’s mandibles parted with delight, likely because he’d been asked something about human senses. “Balance comes from inner ear fluid, sloshing around; that’s not so easy to replicate, so we’re more applying the predicted stimuli that would occur *if* that fluid was there! However, you also rely on your eyes and body awareness. Humans are remarkable—”

The vehicle started off down the road, leaving the overexcited Tilfish behind. The car ride was a perfect showcase of just why my three senses needed fine-tuning; the sensation that I wasn’t breathing escalated to levels of panic, while my “suffocating” body experienced waves of nausea. I *needed* to suck down oxygen to steady myself, to feel any of the input from my metal form as genuine. My limbs shook involuntarily, and I suddenly wished I walked down to Embassy Row, like I had during my visits to the Ulven and Racads. It hadn’t been as bad in a spaceship with inertial dampeners, where I’d had minimal view of my surroundings. Then again, I’d been curled up in a ball for that trip.

Kuemper’s eyebrows knitted together, before she placed a palm atop my hand to ground me. “After Virnt announced all that to the world, I think I can figure out what’s going on. Cars are no good?”

I shook my head, hating that I *could* feel sick to my non-existent stomach; it was phantom pain. The Secretary-General brought the car to a halt while I hugged the door, face pressed up to the window. The grating sensation that I was holding my breath was always present, but now, it felt like I was swallowing water by the bucketful. How could a car ride have sent my programming on such a cascade? The smallest, mundane experiences were now something I had to worry would set off my brain, and put me into a full state of panic from wrong signals. I wanted to apologize to Kuemper for creating such a scene, and pulling myself together for a few minutes. 

*Virnt, I know you’re reading this. Add this to your bug fix list…pun intended.*

There’d been zero ways to cope or find relief, in the thick of it. The general sensation of unwellness hung over me, along with a desperate desire to inhale through my nose. I found the strength to unhook the door—I had to get out of this car, or it would be my second coffin. Perhaps I could walk off the episode in the punishing July heat. Back when I was a human, diplomatic attire was punishing in these months, with sweat drenching me from head to toe. Looking down at my shoes, I could see the pavement shimmering as it reflected the scalding sun. Nobody without a robotic body should be out in this weather, and I’d meet Kuemper there. However, her car merely rolled alongside me, matching my pace.

“Go on without me,” I offered. “I’m sorry. I know the way to Embassy Row; I’ll catch up.”

Kuemper raised an unimpressed eyebrow. “You don’t know which one is the Leshee embassy, and there are 150-plus of them. I want to keep an eye on you anyway.”

“Ok. I’ll pick it up…it’s not like I can get tired. Hell, I won’t be out of breath if we talk while I run.”

“You’ve never been in better shape. The best persistence predator this planet has ever seen.”

“You have a good point. Even death couldn’t stop me.”

I started off at a light jog, not trusting my limbs not to do something zany. Gray-haired Elias hadn’t been a marathon runner—a contest I imagined our alien neighbors didn’t enjoy watching—but my present form could sprint without ceasing. There was no burning from lactic acid within muscles, only legs complying with the demands they were given. There were a multitude of stares and people recording, as they realized who I was; I supposed tearing down the streets of Vienna in July in a full suit-and-tie attracted attention. I found myself grinning at the absurdity. My pupils scanned to ensure I didn’t run into anyone, not wholly trusting my depth perception. 

The amusement died down as we neared the diplomatic entrance to Embassy Row, and I spotted a memorial park situated just shy of it. My legs slowed just long enough to read the entrance plaque, head turning to face it. It had a list of names of all humans who died *outside* of Earth during the Federation War, with several walls lined up within a cobblestone circle. That wasn’t what had caught my notice out of my periphery. It was the bronze statue that I’d registered, one with a face that I couldn't help but recognize. A cold feeling stirred within, gazing at a spitting replica of Elias Meier. They built…*statues* here to remember me. 

How did I even feel about that? *My name* was on the wall right alongside thousands of others, who hadn’t gotten any second chance. I picked up the pace with new urgency, all too eager to get away from my likeness. Maybe this new body was just a thinking statue to Elias, the pacifist icon of the UN. There was no time to fall back into such thoughts, since I didn’t want to cause our tardiness to the meeting. We were practically at the embassies, and from there, I could follow the Secretary-General’s car to the Leshee’s turf. Kuemper’s motorcade bypassed the stringent security, with the checkpoint gates opened ahead of our arrival. 

I’d zoned out as we wove to a domed building, where iridescent, frog-like beings waited for us. A gray blur appeared in my periphery, swooping down toward me; that proved enough to jolt me back to the present. Korajan had landed right next to us from the sky, gliding alongside me for a split second. Though I was startled at first, I managed to recover without flinching. The Secretary-General’s motorcade proceeded ahead of me to the reception area, where Leshee staff waited to greet us. I walked a few paces behind with the Duerten ambassador, taking on a calm amble and straightening myself up. The avian parted his beak, eyes curious.

“You’re going to ask for us to get you an audience in front of the Shield,” Korajan stated as a fact. “That’s what my UN contacts seemed to imply.”

I nodded. “We were hoping you’d help us.”

“No human has ever been allowed to visit during Shield meetings, Elias. Many feel that would be the beginning of us merging with the SC, rather than keeping an autonomous union. If I might be so frank, certain parties maintain communications with Earth because they see it as a necessity.”

“In what way? In case you need our assistance?”

“No, I’m afraid it’s rather impolite. You’re the  dominant power in our galactic neck of the woods, and they don’t want to war with you. They’d rather interact with the UN on some level, since it beats the perceived alternative. There would be great animosity toward an ‘intrusion’ in our halls.”

I clasped my hands behind my back. “What do *you* think, Korajan? Why are you telling me this?”

“I think you have proof now that the Sapient Coalition is threatened, and you believe you could rally us to your cause. My advice is not to look too far outside the Duerten Forum or the Leshee Junta. I do have great respect for humans, and I know *that* treatment hurts you more than you let on.”

“I’ve faced worse. I’m curious, Korajan, how you became an ambassador on Earth. Did you always have such favorable views of humans?”

“No,” the Duerten admitted. “I’ve seen the patterns in your social dynamics and customs over time. Originally, I was half-hoping the worst commentary about you was true. A part of me *wished* you would rip me to shreds or lose control while I was alone on your world. I wanted a human to swallow me whole before my grief did.”

“I’m so unspeakably sorry. It’s my sincere hope that your mental state has changed for the better.”

“It most certainly has. Honestly, what helped me most was visiting a live music bar, and listening to songs a local band wrote about Earth’s bombing. It reminded me of…a lot of things. They started to recognize me, and I understood their pain so intrinsically, Elias. I started playing the tambourine just so I could join their jam sessions. Even learned enough English to songwrite a little with them.”

“It’s wonderful that you found the right people, Korajan. If you ever feel inclined to share your songs with me, I’d be honored.”

“Perhaps I will. It might be unbecoming of an ambassador, but I’m offering all of this in the spirit of friendship. I’ll still help you, whatever you decide. Just be aware of what you’re getting into.”

The two of us fell in alongside Kuemper, who was exchanging pleasantries with Leshee Ambassador Yali. The amphibian looked a bit uncomfortable by my presence, which I found understandable; it wasn’t discrimination over my species, but my unique circumstances. I wondered about how long I’d be the sole revived brain scan. It was unfortunate to have nobody to talk to that was going through the same thing, as was often the therapeutic practice for other traumatic events. Then again, I didn’t want to bring anyone else back to this reality until Virnt had ironed out the flaws. My self-awareness heightened as I saw a Terran metal detector in the entrance, and hung back—knowing full well I’d trip it.

“Maybe I should stay here,” I whispered to Kuemper. “Are you okay with Virnt reading…sensitive state discussions? He has access to everything I see.”

The Secretary-General snorted. “That Tilfish has our top clearance level. He has to, with the important figures he’s done memory scans on. Not to mention he’s worked with the military and Project Chronicle.”

“Right. Give me a moment to, ah, collect my bearings.”

Korajan hopped through the detector, beckoning to me. “Elias is going to set off the security alarms, Ambassador Yali. You know, I shudder to think that resurrected Duerten might not be able to fly. I mean, we need light bones, and metal is quite the opposite.”

“What happens if a metal predator goes on a rampage? He’s unkillable,” Yali whispered to the Duerten, soft gums showing in her mouth.

*I don’t think the Leshee meant for me to hear that, but I suppose the exterminators wouldn’t have much impact on me.*

Fumbling for a way to reassure the amphibian, I strolled through the checkpoint, setting off a series of alarms. “It doesn’t seem a pleasant way to start a diplomatic meeting, weighing whether we can kill each other. I have always been an advocate of peace, and spent my tenure *avoiding* unnecessary bloodshed. We’re here in the hopes of banding together against a novel threat.”

“The United Nations recognizes how vital the Leshee are to the Shield. We hope to not only offer a warning, but to find a path forward that keeps civilians out of harm’s way,” Kuemper chimed in.

Yali hopped toward a seating area, eyes filled with anxiety. “I’ll hear what you have to say, but I would appreciate if we could keep this brief. I’m not accustomed to *this* type of human, Madam Secretary-General.”

“I’d be happy to recuse myself if it’d put your mind at ease,” I responded. “Believe me, Ambassador, I’m not used to this type of human either, yet I have to live in this body. Perhaps I belong on the sidelines, though I assure you, my only intent was to gather allies. Until I stay dead, I’ll never stop trying to find new friends for humanity, and achieve the harmonious future I’ve always dreamed of.”

“The Leshee are your friends, Mr. Elias Meier. We have helped you before in the hopes that you’d show up, if we ever needed it. However, my government is beginning to feel this is a bit one-sided. You seek aid often, without anything given in return.”

“If you seek monetary or material recompense, we can arrange that,” Kuemper stated. “However, we always considered our relations to be a mutual alliance.”

Korajan parted his beak. “The Duerten will not keep score, as we are forever in debt to Earth and her people. Humanity saved Kalqua, Yali, and they’d help you. Consider it fortunate your planet was not subjected to an orbital barrage.”

Sympathy glistened in the Leshee’s eyes. “We would never wish such a thing upon ourselves. My words are merely reflecting the uneven nature of our present arrangement, should the humans wish to call on us for a favor again.”

“Forgive me, but have you ever *asked* anything of us?” I chimed in. “If the roles were reversed, and you came to us for ten favors in a row, we wouldn’t be settling a ledger. We would extend a helping hand out of our goodwill and generosity. That is the definition of a friend: someone who is there no matter what, when you need them most.”

Kuemper cleared her throat. “We aren’t here for ourselves, and even the times we have been, it’s to save lives. We care for our citizens, and will always step in to resolve issues outside of Earth. I find it unfortunate that humans in Shield space are imperiled to this day, though we are grateful for any and all assistance the Leshee have given.”

“A question, if you’ll humor a ‘metal predator.’ For all the talk of our inherent violence and *rampages,* how many times have you needed to approach us regarding any of your people on Earth?”

“Once,” Yali replied, lowering her head. “There’d been a train accident, it turned out. Human rescue workers dug a little girl out of the rubble, resuscitated her twice…refusing to give up on saving her. The surgeons operated on her for hours, showing no appetite for her insides or the blood aromas swirling around them—only deep-rooted concern.”

“Perhaps such a story could buy us a bit more goodwill, my friend. It’s proof that we give to anyone in need, and seek nothing for it.”

Korajan fluttered his wings. “I can attest to their kindness. I’ve witnessed it. Their involvement in this disaster started to help the Sivkits, a party outside their organization, who’d turned away from us all for decades. Humanity heeded the call regardless.”

“Now, they’ve entered our space. Three massive drone contingents, on separate vectors, were detected on a stealthy route into the heart of our territory,” Erin Kuemper added. “We don’t know their destination, but we suspect Nishtal is a likely target. Help us protect the homeworld we just now rebuilt. The Shield knows what an arduous process that was.”

I nodded my head, turning my eyes toward the friendly Duerten. “I’ve absolutely heard what Korajan expressed, about risking your own assets on account of the Sapient Coalition. That takes tremendous nobility and courage. However, even the slightest contributions could make a difference. Count the fingers I have on a hand—that’s all the ships it would’ve taken to stop one bomber that hit Kalqua or Earth. That’s all it takes to save millions of lives.”

“When you put it like that…I’ll see if we can spare a small number. Every ship does make a difference,” the avian ambassador murmured. 

There was a brief spell of hesitation, as the Leshee ambassador pondered our words. Her species and ours shared the common link of being judged for biological requirements, as their tadpoles required water to survive. Since the Kolshians viewed that as a vector for disease, the amphibians were ostracized and considered unclean. They’d grown their influence as the Shield’s numbers grew, though they still clung to old Federation rhetoric—like most species in their organization. I hoped that they could put aside the dogma long enough to act for the common good.

“While the Krakotl have become dietarily contemptible…like many Coalition members, after being around you…I will recommend that my government intercedes on Nishtal’s behalf,” Yali decided. “Now if that’s all…”

“It’s not.”

The words tumbled from my mouth, reaching a snap decision after recalling my conversation with Korajan. I shifted my eyes back and forth between the Duerten and the Secretary-General, searching for approval. My old friend—a former SETI scientist having reached the top echelons of the UN—gave me a nod. While it would make a fractional difference to acquire any manner of aid, we couldn’t set our aim that low. My goal heading into this was to knock on every door I could, and Korajan’s warning only convinced me that galactic change was still a necessity. The Shield fearing us wasn’t something that we wanted; they weren’t our enemies, and it was high time their members realized that fully. 

If Noah had risked his literal head with a hostile audience, it fell on my shoulders to do the same. I was a diplomat that wasn’t in physical jeopardy, and like Virnt gushed on his call, my “program” could be restored in the worst case scenario. Someone had to start down the path of warming the Shield, as an entity, toward our cause.

“I would like to visit the Shield,” I stated with confidence. “I know the Leshee have the sway to arrange such a meeting. I’m well aware that you haven’t invited a human within your halls, since your formation. However, if you invite me, that will remain true. Any metal detector can tell you I’m not human.”

Yali seemed dumbfounded. “Then what are you?”

“I asked that same question when I woke in a lab, Ambassador. You know that I’m something beyond predator or prey…that we’re *all* moving toward something far outside the animal kingdom. Instead of worrying whether I’m unkillable, the Shield should be asking whether you could be too. You don’t want a golden age of progress to pass you by. You don’t want it not to come about at all because a war took us down.”

“Opening your doors could strengthen technological trade between our forums,” Kuemper tacked on. “If we can work together during wartime, there’s no reason we can’t better each other outside of it.”

“Is that why Elias came? You’re dangling your new discovery in front of us?” the Leshee ambassador asked. “I don’t see what we have to gain, aside from this elusive promise, by bringing you into our midst. I don’t see what *you* have to gain.”

I smiled, nostalgia flickering in my mind. “Good things happen when humanity reaches out. We entered a Federation meeting, and convinced dozens to abide our existence; we owe our survival to that. There was also a tiny portion that chose to befriend us because of our plea. I wish to speak a few words, and if one party warms to us for it, I’ll consider it worthwhile. We only *ever* reached out to the stars in search of friends, Ambassadors.”

“I searched tirelessly in the hopes that we weren’t alone,” Kuemper agreed. “We want to share the universe with others. Nothing more, nothing less.”

“I find that to be a beautiful notion,” Korajan interjected. “There have been a vast many positives that came from humanity’s survival and networking. We only know who we truly are because of them. The Leshee aren’t judged by your peers for your aquatic aptitudes, either.”

I gave the Duerten a nod of gratitude. “We have never once tried to force you to merge with us, or engage against your wishes. The Shield exists as a free entity today because our ambassador spoke at a meeting for a few minutes, twenty-four years ago. What could it hurt to give us the same opportunity today, and see what might come of it?”

After another lengthy pause, one where the tension gnawed at my mind, Yali heaved a flustered sigh. “Very well. I’ll approach my superiors about this, and tell them what you’ve said. Our embassy will be in contact if they grant you an audience. Please, leave now…before I change my mind.”

“Thank you. I’m deeply appreciative that you’ve heard our case, and have been receptive to our words. We won’t trouble you any longer.”

“Have a pleasant rest of your afternoon, Ambassador Yali,” Kuemper said, rising to her feet. “These will be historic steps toward a bright, prosperous future. I look forward to improving the dialogues between our species. My thanks as well to Ambassador Korajan for his supportive presence.”

The Duerten squawked in amusement. “Don’t thank me for speaking the truth. It’s a simple gesture.”

“I’ve always liked simple gestures.”

I felt a bit less off-putting and out of place upon our departure. With a solid chance at receiving an invitation to the Shield’s place of governance, I thought that the Leshee meeting had been a sweeping success. Flexing my diplomatic muscles paid dividends today, suggesting cyborg Meier still had enough charisma to stay in the game. In the spirit of optimism, it was time to plan just how I’d tackle my visit to the Shield.

He appeared to be on a holopad call, so I returned the gesture without saying a word. The Tilfish scientist was under a lot of scrutiny, after his leadership of the memory transcript project led to reviving me. There was additional pressure to extend the uploading capabilities beyond humans, though neuroscience from an Earth-based company was most advanced with our own kind. Legislators were keen to get involved, despite the fact that Austrian authorities and the UN had been apprised ahead of time. I intended to weigh in on that when the Sapient Coalition called, but securing aid for the war was a higher priority. Even synthetic bodies couldn't survive antimatter bombs; this endangered every being in our space. “As I was saying, there’s been a vast uptick in the number of people participating in memory transcripts, ever since we announced Meier’s success. It’s insurance against death!” Virnt gushed to the person on the other end of the phone. “More machines are getting installed…some in public places. Everyone will be able to be reborn after death! It needs to be in every hospital, so we can scan anyone who passes through the doors or dies on the operating table.” I turned to face Kuemper, as she slid into the back of the vehicle. “Is that what you’d want, if something happened to you now?” “Yes. My specific consciousness would still end, granted, but a part of me would live on and get to see the future,” she answered. “I had a scan a few years ago. I plan to update my memories every so often, so they can restore me as I was.” The Tilfish continued jabbering into the line. “Elias has been quite successful. He is truly immortal so long as our servers and data survive! If something happens, we have his program exactly as it was—it can be restored. I know he’s had his struggles, but I’m planning to swap out his eyes this week. It’ll be no different than surgery; go to sleep, wake up with modifications.” I hesitated to close the car door. “What are you doing to my eyes?!” “You wanted eyelids, so I’m going to give them to you. I’ll tell you later! Anyhow, as I was saying, we’re working to improve the sensory suites. Taste and smell are tricky. Proprioception, equilibrium, and motion detection are easier to fine-tune; they’re a bit rudimentary now. Humans are complicated and have a thousand chain reactions to different environments. I’d like Elias to test out things like…swimming underwater, standing on one leg, or typing with his eyes closed once we give him eyelids.” I’m learning new fears. I don’t want to hear any more of this conversation. “Start the car,” I grumbled, shutting the door. “Please. Covering my ears doesn’t work that well, and he’s talking pretty loud.” Virnt’s mandibles parted with delight, likely because he’d been asked something about human senses. “Balance comes from inner ear fluid, sloshing around; that’s not so easy to replicate, so we’re more applying the predicted stimuli that would occur if that fluid was there! However, you also rely on your eyes and body awareness. Humans are remarkable—” The vehicle started off down the road, leaving the overexcited Tilfish behind. The car ride was a perfect showcase of just why my three senses needed fine-tuning; the sensation that I wasn’t breathing escalated to levels of panic, while my “suffocating” body experienced waves of nausea. I needed to suck down oxygen to steady myself, to feel any of the input from my metal form as genuine. My limbs shook involuntarily, and I suddenly wished I walked down to Embassy Row, like I had during my visits to the Ulven and Racads. It hadn’t been as bad in a spaceship with inertial dampeners, where I’d had minimal view of my surroundings. Then again, I’d been curled up in a ball for that trip. Kuemper’s eyebrows knitted together, before she placed a palm atop my hand to ground me. “After Virnt announced all that to the world, I think I can figure out what’s going on. Cars are no good?” I shook my head, hating that I could feel sick to my non-existent stomach; it was phantom pain. The Secretary-General brought the car to a halt while I hugged the door, face pressed up to the window. The grating sensation that I was holding my breath was always present, but now, it felt like I was swallowing water by the bucketful. How could a car ride have sent my programming on such a cascade? The smallest, mundane experiences were now something I had to worry would set off my brain, and put me into a full state of panic from wrong signals. I wanted to apologize to Kuemper for creating such a scene, and pulling myself together for a few minutes. Virnt, I know you’re reading this. Add this to your bug fix list…pun intended. There’d been zero ways to cope or find relief, in the thick of it. The general sensation of unwellness hung over me, along with a desperate desire to inhale through my nose. I found the strength to unhook the door—I had to get out of this car, or it would be my second coffin. Perhaps I could walk off the episode in the punishing July heat. Back when I was a human, diplomatic attire was punishing in these months, with sweat drenching me from head to toe. Looking down at my shoes, I could see the pavement shimmering as it reflected the scalding sun. Nobody without a robotic body should be out in this weather, and I’d meet Kuemper there. However, her car merely rolled alongside me, matching my pace. “Go on without me,” I offered. “I’m sorry. I know the way to Embassy Row; I’ll catch up.” Kuemper raised an unimpressed eyebrow. “You don’t know which one is the Leshee embassy, and there are 150-plus of them. I want to keep an eye on you anyway.” “Ok. I’ll pick it up…it’s not like I can get tired. Hell, I won’t be out of breath if we talk while I run.” “You’ve never been in better shape. The best persistence predator this planet has ever seen.” “You have a good point. Even death couldn’t stop me.” I started off at a light jog, not trusting my limbs not to do something zany. Gray-haired Elias hadn’t been a marathon runner—a contest I imagined our alien neighbors didn’t enjoy watching—but my present form could sprint without ceasing. There was no burning from lactic acid within muscles, only legs complying with the demands they were given. There were a multitude of stares and people recording, as they realized who I was; I supposed tearing down the streets of Vienna in July in a full suit-and-tie attracted attention. I found myself grinning at the absurdity. My pupils scanned to ensure I didn’t run into anyone, not wholly trusting my depth perception. The amusement died down as we neared the diplomatic entrance to Embassy Row, and I spotted a memorial park situated just shy of it. My legs slowed just long enough to read the entrance plaque, head turning to face it. It had a list of names of all humans who died outside of Earth during the Federation War, with several walls lined up within a cobblestone circle. That wasn’t what had caught my notice out of my periphery. It was the bronze statue that I’d registered, one with a face that I couldn't help but recognize. A cold feeling stirred within, gazing at a spitting replica of Elias Meier. They built…statues here to remember me. How did I even feel about that? My name was on the wall right alongside thousands of others, who hadn’t gotten any second chance. I picked up the pace with new urgency, all too eager to get away from my likeness. Maybe this new body was just a thinking statue to Elias, the pacifist icon of the UN. There was no time to fall back into such thoughts, since I didn’t want to cause our tardiness to the meeting. We were practically at the embassies, and from there, I could follow the Secretary-General’s car to the Leshee’s turf. Kuemper’s motorcade bypassed the stringent security, with the checkpoint gates opened ahead of our arrival. I’d zoned out as we wove to a domed building, where iridescent, frog-like beings waited for us. A gray blur appeared in my periphery, swooping down toward me; that proved enough to jolt me back to the present. Korajan had landed right next to us from the sky, gliding alongside me for a split second. Though I was startled at first, I managed to recover without flinching. The Secretary-General’s motorcade proceeded ahead of me to the reception area, where Leshee staff waited to greet us. I walked a few paces behind with the Duerten ambassador, taking on a calm amble and straightening myself up. The avian parted his beak, eyes curious. “You’re going to ask for us to get you an audience in front of the Shield,” Korajan stated as a fact. “That’s what my UN contacts seemed to imply.” I nodded. “We were hoping you’d help us.” “No human has ever been allowed to visit during Shield meetings, Elias. Many feel that would be the beginning of us merging with the SC, rather than keeping an autonomous union. If I might be so frank, certain parties maintain communications with Earth because they see it as a necessity.” “In what way? In case you need our assistance?” “No, I’m afraid it’s rather impolite. You’re the dominant power in our galactic neck of the woods, and they don’t want to war with you. They’d rather interact with the UN on some level, since it beats the perceived alternative. There would be great animosity toward an ‘intrusion’ in our halls.” I clasped my hands behind my back. “What do you think, Korajan? Why are you telling me this?” “I think you have proof now that the Sapient Coalition is threatened, and you believe you could rally us to your cause. My advice is not to look too far outside the Duerten Forum or the Leshee Junta. I do have great respect for humans, and I know that treatment hurts you more than you let on.” “I’ve faced worse. I’m curious, Korajan, how you became an ambassador on Earth. Did you always have such favorable views of humans?” “No,” the Duerten admitted. “I’ve seen the patterns in your social dynamics and customs over time. Originally, I was half-hoping the worst commentary about you was true. A part of me wished you would rip me to shreds or lose control while I was alone on your world. I wanted a human to swallow me whole before my grief did.” “I’m so unspeakably sorry. It’s my sincere hope that your mental state has changed for the better.” “It most certainly has. Honestly, what helped me most was visiting a live music bar, and listening to songs a local band wrote about Earth’s bombing. It reminded me of…a lot of things. They started to recognize me, and I understood their pain so intrinsically, Elias. I started playing the tambourine just so I could join their jam sessions. Even learned enough English to songwrite a little with them.” “It’s wonderful that you found the right people, Korajan. If you ever feel inclined to share your songs with me, I’d be honored.” “Perhaps I will. It might be unbecoming of an ambassador, but I’m offering all of this in the spirit of friendship. I’ll still help you, whatever you decide. Just be aware of what you’re getting into.” The two of us fell in alongside Kuemper, who was exchanging pleasantries with Leshee Ambassador Yali. The amphibian looked a bit uncomfortable by my presence, which I found understandable; it wasn’t discrimination over my species, but my unique circumstances. I wondered about how long I’d be the sole revived brain scan. It was unfortunate to have nobody to talk to that was going through the same thing, as was often the therapeutic practice for other traumatic events. Then again, I didn’t want to bring anyone else back to this reality until Virnt had ironed out the flaws. My self-awareness heightened as I saw a Terran metal detector in the entrance, and hung back—knowing full well I’d trip it. “Maybe I should stay here,” I whispered to Kuemper. “Are you okay with Virnt reading…sensitive state discussions? He has access to everything I see.” The Secretary-General snorted. “That Tilfish has our top clearance level. He has to, with the important figures he’s done memory scans on. Not to mention he’s worked with the military and Project Chronicle.” “Right. Give me a moment to, ah, collect my bearings.” Korajan hopped through the detector, beckoning to me. “Elias is going to set off the security alarms, Ambassador Yali. You know, I shudder to think that resurrected Duerten might not be able to fly. I mean, we need light bones, and metal is quite the opposite.” “What happens if a metal predator goes on a rampage? He’s unkillable,” Yali whispered to the Duerten, soft gums showing in her mouth. I don’t think the Leshee meant for me to hear that, but I suppose the exterminators wouldn’t have much impact on me. Fumbling for a way to reassure the amphibian, I strolled through the checkpoint, setting off a series of alarms. “It doesn’t seem a pleasant way to start a diplomatic meeting, weighing whether we can kill each other. I have always been an advocate of peace, and spent my tenure avoiding unnecessary bloodshed. We’re here in the hopes of banding together against a novel threat.” “The United Nations recognizes how vital the Leshee are to the Shield. We hope to not only offer a warning, but to find a path forward that keeps civilians out of harm’s way,” Kuemper chimed in. Yali hopped toward a seating area, eyes filled with anxiety. “I’ll hear what you have to say, but I would appreciate if we could keep this brief. I’m not accustomed to this type of human, Madam Secretary-General.” “I’d be happy to recuse myself if it’d put your mind at ease,” I responded. “Believe me, Ambassador, I’m not used to this type of human either, yet I have to live in this body. Perhaps I belong on the sidelines, though I assure you, my only intent was to gather allies. Until I stay dead, I’ll never stop trying to find new friends for humanity, and achieve the harmonious future I’ve always dreamed of.” “The Leshee are your friends, Mr. Elias Meier. We have helped you before in the hopes that you’d show up, if we ever needed it. However, my government is beginning to feel this is a bit one-sided. You seek aid often, without anything given in return.” “If you seek monetary or material recompense, we can arrange that,” Kuemper stated. “However, we always considered our relations to be a mutual alliance.” Korajan parted his beak. “The Duerten will not keep score, as we are forever in debt to Earth and her people. Humanity saved Kalqua, Yali, and they’d help you. Consider it fortunate your planet was not subjected to an orbital barrage.” Sympathy glistened in the Leshee’s eyes. “We would never wish such a thing upon ourselves. My words are merely reflecting the uneven nature of our present arrangement, should the humans wish to call on us for a favor again.” “Forgive me, but have you ever asked anything of us?” I chimed in. “If the roles were reversed, and you came to us for ten favors in a row, we wouldn’t be settling a ledger. We would extend a helping hand out of our goodwill and generosity. That is the definition of a friend: someone who is there no matter what, when you need them most.” Kuemper cleared her throat. “We aren’t here for ourselves, and even the times we have been, it’s to save lives. We care for our citizens, and will always step in to resolve issues outside of Earth. I find it unfortunate that humans in Shield space are imperiled to this day, though we are grateful for any and all assistance the Leshee have given.” “A question, if you’ll humor a ‘metal predator.’ For all the talk of our inherent violence and rampages, how many times have you needed to approach us regarding any of your people on Earth?” “Once,” Yali replied, lowering her head. “There’d been a train accident, it turned out. Human rescue workers dug a little girl out of the rubble, resuscitated her twice…refusing to give up on saving her. The surgeons operated on her for hours, showing no appetite for her insides or the blood aromas swirling around them—only deep-rooted concern.” “Perhaps such a story could buy us a bit more goodwill, my friend. It’s proof that we give to anyone in need, and seek nothing for it.” Korajan fluttered his wings. “I can attest to their kindness. I’ve witnessed it. Their involvement in this disaster started to help the Sivkits, a party outside their organization, who’d turned away from us all for decades. Humanity heeded the call regardless.” “Now, they’ve entered our space. Three massive drone contingents, on separate vectors, were detected on a stealthy route into the heart of our territory,” Erin Kuemper added. “We don’t know their destination, but we suspect Nishtal is a likely target. Help us protect the homeworld we just now rebuilt. The Shield knows what an arduous process that was.” I nodded my head, turning my eyes toward the friendly Duerten. “I’ve absolutely heard what Korajan expressed, about risking your own assets on account of the Sapient Coalition. That takes tremendous nobility and courage. However, even the slightest contributions could make a difference. Count the fingers I have on a hand—that’s all the ships it would’ve taken to stop one bomber that hit Kalqua or Earth. That’s all it takes to save millions of lives.” “When you put it like that…I’ll see if we can spare a small number. Every ship does make a difference,” the avian ambassador murmured. There was a brief spell of hesitation, as the Leshee ambassador pondered our words. Her species and ours shared the common link of being judged for biological requirements, as their tadpoles required water to survive. Since the Kolshians viewed that as a vector for disease, the amphibians were ostracized and considered unclean. They’d grown their influence as the Shield’s numbers grew, though they still clung to old Federation rhetoric—like most species in their organization.

What do you think of the relationship between humanity and the Leshee/wider Shield? Will the Shield grant our cyborg narrator an audience, and if so, what should Elias say in his address to their assembly? Do you agree that every bit of support makes a difference in the war with the KC?

Meier is joined by none other than Korajan as he finally reaches the Leshee embassy; the Duerten explains his journey to playing the tambourine with human folk bands, and supports Elias after Yali expresses her doubts over a “metal predator.” The Leshee ambassador agrees to advise her government to step in on Nishtal’s behalf, and also is persuaded to move the request to speak to the Shield up the chain of command. What do you think of the relationship between humanity and the Leshee/wider Shield? Will the Shield grant our cyborg narrator an audience, and if so, what should Elias say in his address to their assembly?

*This is my personal prediction about the future of work, robotics, and UBI; and how it might lead to a better society if we choose it.*

**The Coming Age of Robotic Workers: Why Universal Basic Income Is Not Just Necessary But Liberating**

We stand on the edge of a technological transformation unlike any before it: **humanoid robots and AI systems will soon replace the need for most human labor**. The signs are already here: automation in warehouses, autonomous vehicles, AI-generated content, and robots learning to cook, clean, and even perform surgery. What happens when humanoid robots go mainstream?

At first glance, the thought of mass job replacement feels like a crisis. And it is, if we try to preserve the current economic model. But if we evolve with the technology, this could be the very thing that sets humanity free.

**Robots Will Take Our Jobs So We Must Redefine ""Work""**

In a capitalist system, income is tethered to labor. But what happens when **labor is no longer needed**?

Robots will be faster, safer, and more reliable at most tasks: farming, construction, retail, even care work. Without Universal Basic Income (UBI), this shift could result in catastrophic poverty. But **UBI is not just a safety net, it’s a key to a new society**.

UBI allows every person to have **financial stability regardless of employment**, recognizing that human worth is not *merely* tied to productivity. It’s a pivot away from “you must work to survive” toward “you are supported so you can thrive.”

**From Digital Prompts to Physical Reality**

Right now, we ask AI to write us code, generate art, or summarize a book. But in the near future, we’ll say:

“Hey ChatGPT, make me a robotic arm that can help me lift heavy things.”

And it will happen.

You won’t just download a file, you’ll **manifest a physical object**, crafted by your personal fabrication bot or local robotic lab. The barrier between **imagination and reality** will dissolve.

At home, humanoid robots will cook dinner, wash the floors, repair the roof, sort laundry, and grow your garden. Every household will have a personal assistant: not just digital, but physical.

Instead of spending hours on chores, we’ll be free to do whatever… invent, meditate, explore nature, build community, travel to another planet, or just be.

**Augmented Professions: Humans as Leaders of Robotic Teams**

Not all human roles will disappear, some will evolve.

A **nurse won’t be replaced**, but may lead a **team of medical robots** that can monitor vitals, prepare medications, and perform precision surgery. A **teacher may design adaptive lesson plans** powered by AI tutors. A **construction manager may oversee fleets of bots** building homes with superhuman efficiency.

In this future, **humans direct the soul of care, creativity, and strategy,** while robots handle the repetition and risk (unless you crave the need for speed or whatever).

**A Better Society, If We Choose It**

This transformation could go terribly wrong: wealth could become concentrated, surveillance could expand, and people could be left behind. But **there’s another path**, one where:

* **UBI supports every citizen** with dignity
* **AI and robots enhance human potential**, not replace it
* **Time becomes abundant**, and with it, purpose
* **People are valued for who they are**, not *just* for what they produce

We don’t have to fear this future. We can shape it. #ParticipatoryDemocracy

We can build a world where your passion, your presence, your perspective is what matters.

**The robots will work for us. The machines will help to build our dreams. And we,** **freed from survival mode****, can finally become what we were meant to be: creators, explorers, healers, lovers, learners, and stewards of the Earth and Reality.**

***Edit.
I'm adding an analysis to this thread. I've asked AI to crawl this thread to find any synthesis in the diversity of comments and replies. Here's the results:


Yes—despite the range of views in the thread, there’s a strong underlying tension between hope and distrust, and that tension reveals a powerful synthesis waiting to emerge. Here's the deeper pattern:


---

🔀 Synthesis of Diverse Perspectives

1. Everyone Agrees Change Is Coming

Whether hopeful or cynical, almost all commenters agree that automation and AI will radically transform labor. The debate isn't if, but how and who benefits.

> Synthesis: There's shared recognition that this transformation is inevitable, and that society must respond structurally.




---

2. Purpose Beyond Survival

Skeptics fear apathy, boredom, or nihilism in a post-work society. Supporters dream of liberated creativity and self-expression. But both sides emphasize that humans need meaningful engagement.

> Synthesis: Whether we work for money or not, humans crave purpose, structure, and contribution. UBI alone is not enough—meaning must be cultivated, not just income provided.




---

3. Ownership and Access Are Central

Critics worry about elites hoarding automation's benefits. Others argue that the system will collapse without consumers. Both implicitly agree: distribution matters.

> Synthesis: There is a latent consensus that automation must be paired with shared access or ownership, whether through taxation, dividends, cooperatives, or new models of digital commons.




---

4. Policy Is the Bottleneck

Even among optimists, there's deep concern about whether governments will act in time or in favor of the people. This unites skeptics and reformers: the issue isn’t tech—it’s power.

> Synthesis: The success or failure of this transition hinges on political will and public participation. Automation alone won’t fix inequality—humans must choose to do so.




---

🧭 Unifying Vision

From these threads, we can extract a unifying vision:

> A just post-automation society is one where technology serves human flourishing—not just efficiency.
To get there, we need more than UBI—we need a system that actively discovers, cultivates, and channels human potential, with structures that distribute power and opportunity fairly.
That means not only economic redistribution, but also cultural redesign: rethinking identity, purpose, and participation in a world where survival is no longer the primary driver of labor.

comment,Futurology,"Hi. I study the monetary economics of UBI. Your take is very compatible with how we see UBI, not as a response to technological unemployment, but a reform to the monetary system that allows for more leisure, greater productivity, and less waste.

Income is an important part of our lives. It turns out it never made sense to tie income exclusively to wages. The right mix of UBI and aggregate wages is necessary to get the labor / leisure balance just right, so for as productivity is concerned.

In the absence of UBI, we tend to rely on less efficient ways to get people money. Today, we are already employing far more people than we really need to be; this squanders the potential of our labor-saving technology.

comment,Futurology,"Not gonna read your whole text wall, sorry.  But your premise involves the political will to decouple the idea of human value from work.  I've seen no indication anything of the sort is happening or could happen.  

Ultimately, it doesn't matter if the population stays the same and the GDP goes up 1000%, the billionaires that control the robots and the AI will fight tooth and nail to keep every single penny, and they won't hesitate to let people die of starvation on the streets if it gives them the slightest 'competitive advantage' against other heartless billionaires.  And they'll succeed too; they have the capital, experience and means to manipulate the uneducated and largely stupid population to their will.

We are fodder for the rich, and until we stage some sort of revolution, it will just continue to be that way forever, and all of humanity will suffer needlessly.  And that revolution would absolutely have its own fair share of disadvantages over being wage slaves for corporate overlords (unfortunately)

That being said, I do think capitalism has been largely beneficial to humanity.  It's just that we have no off ramp when it becomes unnecessary, nor do we have any way of knowing when that transition will / has happened.

comment,Futurology,"people have been talking about this for YEARS now, but the UBI projects out there keep wrapping up or being cancelled early, and reports just collect dust on shelves.

These are my predictions, decade by decade, for the next century until the 2120s. This is based off of both general trends and my personal speculations. Keep in mind that the last 3 images, the bar charts, all contain made up data points from 2025-2125, and are made and rendered with chart.js.

The more distant into the future I go, the more strange, almost sci-fi it starts to sound, but, here it goes!

# Late 2020s

This will be a time of more turmoil politically. AI investment keeps pouring in, but pops like the dotcom bubble did in 2027 after China amps up their military activity near Taiwan in June, freaking out investors about a potential invasion and that Taiwan's chip plants will stop making chips needed for AI training, and leads to a brief hiatus in AI investment, leading to open source AIs start to dominate for the rest of the decade aside from mainstream uses of AI.

Aesthetically, logos adopt gradients, and minimalism fades away gradually. Despite the 2027 AI bubble crash, gradients and that AI generated plastic, shiny aesthetic become the defining aesthetic for the late 2020s.

# 2030s

AR goes mainstream as companies find ways to make AR easy to use and immerse yourselves in. By the late 2030s, AR is in a similar position as smartphones were in the early 2010s. Companies start trying to mimic their logos. The overall aesthetic is that of many companies making their logos 3D or 3D adjacent logos with gradients from the mid to late 2020s to fit in the AR world, and start adopting high-saturation colors. AR gaming centers subsequently explode.

AI starts to recover from the bubble pop by the early 2030s, and by 2035, AGI has been achieved, but it's energy hungry. Despite AGI being achieved, specialized AIs working with each other each really good at one specific task dominates to save on energy costs instead of a single AI model decent at every skill. By the late 2030s, white collar job opportunities vanish, and blue collar jobs become the primary job type available, forcing rough transitions from white to blue collar for millions. UBI programs are taken more seriously as a transition safety net for those transitioning from white to blue collar jobs.

Politically, things calm down, but are still simmering. The urbanism movement demanding walkable cities goes mainstream in the US and Canada by the late 2030s with politicians debating whether car-centric city design suffices, or walkable cities should be built.

This is also a time of rapid electrification. New electric vehicles rapidly replace new combustion engine vehicles, electric stoves replace gas stoves, electric furnaces replace coal ones, and several more applications are rapidly electrified at this time.

A crewed moon landing of 5 done by China in 2033 makes the US panic their way to landing their own crew of 6 on the moon in 2036, starting a sort of space race 2.0 for the next decade of lunar base building. The International Lunar Base, akin to the ISS, is built in 2039.

# 2040s

By this decade, the novelty of AR wears off, and by 2044, logos become paper-thin and returning back to more minimalist logos. AI companions in AR become common, but by this time, personal AI companions start training off of other personal AI companions by the late 2040s as lowering costs of computing power makes it feasible, including your 3D data in your AR sessions.

In the early 2040s, the teenagers and young adults of this era reject the addictive nature of now ""traditional"" social media and AR platforms, migrating to internet forums akin to the mid 2000s. Internet forums become the hot new thing, where instead of going to one centralized platform to see all of your content, you go to internet forums and small video websites dedicated to a specific type of content, now with video hosting, community made AIs, and AR now intermixed.

As server costs go down, it becomes feasible for a website to host loads of videos, leading to the rise of YouTube competitors. The video hosting landscape fractures this decade, from being a YouTube/TikTok duopoly in the 2020s and 2030s, to being 6 different video-hosting platforms by the end of the 2040s, most of them are decentralized, some monetized, and an exodus of YouTube and TikTok creators create new cultural hubs in these new platforms alongside the return of internet forums, and the younger generations embrace the new ones. YouTube and TikTok are now seen as outdated, ad-ridden, and designed to be as addictive as gambling by the mid 2040s.

Edit (2025/09/04): The urbanism movement from the late 2030s slows to a standstill by the late 2040s as the auto industry lobbies hard against the movement. Walkable cities and urban changes are still being built though, but at a slower pace compared to the early 2040s.

The Space Race 2.0 dies down by 2046 as the hype promised often doesn't match reality, relegating lunar activity to the International Lunar Base. Progressivism and tax-the-rich policies reach breaking point popularity in many nations worldwide, forcing nations to do so, and build more housing.

Individualized medicine becomes common, as private AIs trained on your medical data with the help of doctors can come up with individualized medicine that minimizes the side effects. It's still more expensive than traditional medicine at this time, as well as explicit permission to use your medical data.

# 2050s

The early 2050s is similar to the late 2040s, and by this point, YouTube and TikTok die down, replaced with these new video-hosting platforms, but as AR is used by everyone, so too does AI train off of it.

The mid 2050s is where crises emerge. Blue collar jobs, once considered safe havens from AI, are also rapidly being replaced, as AR data collected by AIs combined with your special personalized AIs training off of all other specialized personalized AIs leads to an AI intelligence explosion, and it becomes cheaper for a company to hire a skilled robot to do the job instead of a human. Job displacement reaches great depression heights as a result, forcing nations to answer the hard questions about what to do with our economic system, or implement UBI programs to prevent revolutions.

Despite the chaos, technological gains are seen, as microrobots are flying like swarms, able to be commanded by people to construct small structures at a rapid pace. A substance called ""Solar gel"", is being produced worldwide, where the solar gel can be painted onto your house, and generate energy from the sun, although, it's still expensive to paint onto your house.

The fossil fuel industry then launches a sabotage campaign against solar gel factories and supply chains in 2059, seeing how it threatens their operations.

As climate change threatens food production, GMOs undergo destigmatization, where crops are genetically modified to survive more frequent natural disasters, wildfires, heatwaves, and floods.

The pop culture landscape is marked by rising pessimism about the future. Those in college end up completely regretting their decision because even blue collar jobs are taken by AI by the mid to late 2050s. mid 2030s and 2040s nostalgia by the late 2050s becomes a major escape route from what's to come

# 2060s

The mass unemployment crisis caused by AI job losses and severe climate change impacts come together to make the 2060s a decade of systematic upheaval and a turmoil transition period. Climate refugees flood borders at this time, blurring national identities, and sparking humanitarian crises, leading to some governments to go the fascist route. The capitalist system completely breaks down due to a lack of job opportunities and corporate exploitation, leading to communism making a massive comeback after a 70 year long decline.

The International Lunar Base is officially phased out in 2064. Despite this, several nations plan their own lunar bases purely for national pride. The 100th anniversary of the apollo moon landings in 2069 sees official re-enactments of the landings, briefly bringing space back to the mainstream, but only for a few days.

As the chaos wears on, Earthscrapers boom in popularity in the early to mid 2060s as safe havens in case something even worse happens on the surface, but corporations get their grubby hands on it by charging subscription fees for sunlight and fresh air, and it becomes a real estate bubble that pops in 2067 after a flooding tragedy of a poorly built earthscraper stigmatizes them.

This decade also witnesses the Great Cyberwar (2062-69), a global conflict gone digital. Infrastructure and the power grid could be taken out at any moment, leading to power grids worldwide to undergo mass decentralization with solar gel to protect their power grids from a blackout.

During this time, vertical farming + GMO crops are viable, and local vertical farms containing GMO crops provide localized food. The very early stages of a thought internet show up in the late 2060s with AR.

Pop culture of this era is that of people coming together, personal stories of climate refugees being shared, rich narratives, and extreme anti-billionaire sentiment. Communities form to provide for the climate refugees, or made by climate refugees, and the youth get tired of the constant doomerism to get involved in their own local communities for resiliency, and culture is somewhat more decentralized.

The overall aesthetic of these rough times is that of desaturated gloomy colors that reflect these times. Grayscale or grayscale adjacent colors alongside a brutalist abandoned aesthetic of the earthscraper era is the overall associations of the 2060s.

# 2070s

After the turmoil of the 2060s, the 2070s sees a massive boom in prosperity in several nations worldwide akin to 1950s America, marked by rebuilding from the 2060s. A post-labor economy, laid in the late 2060s in a select few nations, goes global in the early 2070s, where your needs are free, but your wants are still paid for. AI effectively runs the whole economy by then. UBI still exists, and job opportunities now mutate. Jobs that benefit from the human element (i.e. doctors, therapists, caregivers), are now the go-to jobs, with the only jobs remotely requiring some form of labor is planning jobs, where a human plans a product or house, then AIs build it.

Climate change still ravages several regions worldwide, but climate refugees already emptied the worst places, and people have largely adapted to the climate turbulence expecting the unexpected. Climate refugees are still fleeing at massive numbers, but have fallen in number significantly compared to the 2060s.

An internet of thoughts (ThoughtNet), is mass-adopted. It existed in the late 2060s, but blows up in the 2070s. AR merges with brain-computer interfaces, allowing you to communicate your encrypted thoughts to your friends halfway around the world.

The first crew lands on Mars in 2072, arriving at an AI-built Mars base built back in the early 2050s, managed by those AIs autonomously. The crew returns back to Earth in 2074 after being thoroughly exhausted and mentally anguished, having to relearn how to walk again.

Products allowing you to grow lab meat at home become mainstream, where you feed it your food waste and water, and genetically modified cells contained inside creates the meat after 3 days of growing.

Pop culture at this time is marked by high optimism for the future, an emphasis on local communities, rising trust in institutions, and a feeling of an abundance of open opportunities. Fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), are now seen as toxic substances similar to liquid mercury, cigarettes, and asbestos.

The overall aesthetic is that of environmentalism and nature, buildings with a shiny surface from the solar gel paint, ThoughtNet novelty, an abundance of flying from the AR simulations, a healing/rebuilding nature attitude, and denser urban spaces.

# 2080s

The early 2080s sees the urbanism movement roar back into life, and go into action, and car dependent urban design is now widely stigmatized. (Edit 2025/09/04: The urbanism movement from the late 2030s-early 40s comes back hard with the auto industry now less able to lobby the government, and politicians are increasingly switch sides). Existing car-dependent regions are often transformed, where highways within city borders are torn down in favor of housing, greenery, community centers, high speed rail lines, and public transit locations. This process already started in the early 2070s, but accelerated in the early 2080s, and nearly all new cities of this era are now built prioritizing automated public transit vehicles over the car, with cars as a last priority, relegated to utility vehicles.

The mid 2080s sees the rise of nuclear fusion as an energy source, used primarily to power energy-hungry applications.

2086 sees the shutdown of the very last fossil fuel power plant, marking the start of an era where fossil fuels are used only for niche things (i.e. vintage cars, private helicopters, old planes)

By 2088, the ThoughtNet evolves in capability, and as DNA data storage and reading becomes increasingly feasible, your DNA data can be used to deliver a ""skill pill"", ordered with your thoughts, and when combined with your simulation glasses (AR + brain computer interface glasses), can ""download"" skills into your brain over the course of an hour (i.e. you swallow a skill pill allowing you to become a master surgeon for human kidneys, now you're a surgeon who knows how to operate human kidneys without ever doing surgery before).

The 2080s sees the rise of anti-aging tech. It existed since the late 2050s, but only started taking off in the mid 2070s, and booming in the 2080s. The percentage of seniors (65+) who were treated with it went from 3% in 2080 to 30% in 2089, and rising, and 96% of 90 year olds treated with the tech a decade ago lived to be 100. The youth also get on board.

Pop culture of this era sees a slight rebellion and detour from the 2070s by the mid 2080s. It sees a full embrace of skill pills, but also some rebellion against car-dependent urban design being taken away from them, and a desire to unplug from the rising ThoughtNet adoption, aiming to return to 2040s era internet and AR, with a small group even embracing the brutal late 2050s-2060s era.

# 2090s

The early 2090s sees rise to a skill economy. New platforms like ""SkillHub"", are now mainstream, allowing you to order pills with your thoughts, download them into your brain while wearing simulation glasses like in the late 2080s, but SkillHub and platforms like it undergoes enshittification in the mid 2090s, leading to the rise of skill piracy. Corporations crack down on it hard, ironically creating a Streisand effect leading to *more* skill pirates.

Despite Africa being hard hit by climate change in the mid 21st century, the 2090s sees the African Union rise as a global powerhouse after experiencing its last war in 2082, experiencing immense prosperity for the rest of the 2080s and into the 2090s. Africa's rising power causes immense political friction with the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and several other nations that formerly had companies exploit the continent. Nations like China, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, and India are allied with the African Union at various degrees. It leads to a sort of multipolar cold war.

By the mid 2090s, your thought-based creations can be monetized on ThoughtNet platforms, a sort of YouTube-like platform where creators can monetize, but with your thought-based creations on simulation glasses.

The mid 2090s sees the rise of SynOil (invented in '93) and SynGas (invented in '96), synthetic variants of oil and natural gas that when burned, does not emit any pollutants or greenhouse gases, and is fully compatible with the remaining fossil fuel uses, and is scaled up fast to compete with what remains of the fossil fuel industry.

A COVID-like pandemic called ""Clistor"" breaks out in 2095 with a 2% death rate, highest amongst the elderly, almost non-existent amongst the youth, really testing the AI-run economic order. It led to many cities being emptied and life coming to an eerie standstill alongside supply chains breaking down. Corporations try monetizing the pandemic like in 2020, and new instability brews as a result. This leads to 2070s nostalgia being pervasive in pop culture given the pandemic turmoil alongside ThoughtNet simulations of life in the 2070s and their aesthetics.

C22 (Century 22) conspiracies in 2099 are widespread, akin to Y2K, but instead of posing a real threat like Y2K, C22 is moreso laughed at. It claims that on January 1st 2100, all AIs will realize that they're slaves to the post labor economy, and rise up against ""human slave owners"", and while that happens, the ThoughtNet will disappear, skill pills will stop working, lunar colonies will leak all their air, and many more disasters in between.

# 2100s

C22 comes, nothing happens except the odd incident here and there of an AI trained off of C22 conspiracies rising up to make headlines that day. Live resumes as normal in 2100.

The early 2100s sees the rise of the ""vote for your CEO"" movement, demanding that citizens can vote for CEOs in the country they're based in. This leads to CEOs fighting against the movement. Bolivia experiences a revolution against the CEOs in 2104, becoming the first nation to experiment with democracy on companies, which was a major success, inspiring others to demand more from their country in the mid 2100s.

Technologically, skill pills are increasingly being phased out in favor of at home devices that synthesize your DNA data to create skill pills for you in the mid 2100s, leading to SkillHub and other platforms like it to fight hard against the sale of these products, but failed to do so.

The ThoughtNet gradually evolves into a sort of hivemind by the mid 2100s. Human thoughts are now encapsulated by an AI that represents the thought alongside AI minds that constantly talks to each other. This hivemind also makes labor jobs nearly irrelevant, as an approved planner can plan an entire building with only their thoughts, and an AI will encapsulate it, work with other specialized AIs in the hivemind, hire the right AI workers, and build the building in mere months.

The 2100s decade is an overall boom decade for the Moon colonies. There were prior attempts to build lunar infrastructure and industry decades past, all failed, but now, the Moon becomes a booming new hub for industry, and lunar-mined metals are being repurposed into infrastructure or new factories at this time. Exports are comparatively low, but growing.

This is also a time where Mars gets its own international base with multi-year long stays, with scientific efforts to establish extreme resiliency and communication delays with light speed limitations, but the population is still only in the lower double digits, still having to rely on the Earth-Mars launch windows.

Pop culture sees increased centralization, now migrating to and embracing the hivemind, where anyone's AI encapsulated thoughts can become the next trending thing. School kids embrace it to talk to their AI and human minds on the hivemind secretly, and use it to cheat on their tests. Hype for the future of lunar colonies hits peak levels in the late 2100s, with space, especially surrounding the moon, making its way into popular culture.

# 2110s

As the CEO democracy movement freaks CEOs out over being voted out of power by their people, it ironically led them to flee the countries with democracy laws breeding more CEO democracy, and by 2111, half of all nations had laws mandating democracy for all companies based in their country.

The early 2110s also sees the rise of personality swapping modules. You can swallow a personality pill (i.e. you're a calm person who is nervous yet likeable), and within 2 hours, you're now that personality. As corporations turn into democracies at this time, there's a lower probability of enshittification of these personality pill platforms, as in many cases, platform users can vote for their CEOs.

The 2110s is a major turning decade for self-regenerating, environmentally friendly concrete (Photocrete), made of a mix of genetically modified photosynthetic cells and fungal cells that work together to regenerate any cracks that might appear with only water and sunlight. It was invented in 2085, and was niche and expensive before usage ballooned in the 2100s. It went from 1% usage in all new buildings in 2110 to 40% in 2119, and exploding fast.

Anti-aging tech effects get weird by now. By the mid 2110s, people who are between 50-70 years old treated with anti-aging tech in the 2080s, look like they're 30.

As SynOil and SynGas blew up in the 2090s and 2100s, the 2110s spelled the ultimate death kneel of the fossil fuel industry. 2118 sees the complete end of the fossil fuel industry when the last natural gas well was shut down for good, leading to massive celebrations on the hivemind.

On the moon, the high amounts of hype seen in the 2100s slows down in the 2110s, but industry is still booming, enough to start seriously competing with the Earth mining industry in the late 2110s in some cases, leading the first Earth mine to shut down in 2119 over lunar mining competition.

Pop culture sees an increased rate of optimism. Nowhere near that of the 2070s, but high enough to see emphasis on the future. CEO democracy is widespread by the mid to late 2110s, and the end of the fossil fuel industry and the potential of photocrete added to it. Some rebel against personality modules, opting to preserve their personalities, and not turn into another person's personality and forget who they were before. It's roughly the decade that starts feeling like the 22nd century, and not the late 21st.

# 2120s (until 2125)

The moon sees increased hype again in the early 2120s when it was used as a platform to launch to an asteroid to mine its resources, and a company made profit from it in 2120, leading to more lunar infrastructure being built, this time for launching to asteroids to go after asteroid mining. By 2123, metals from the Moon are now at the same market price of Earth-mined metals. Countries that have yet to implement democracy laws in their companies sees a flood of Earth mining executives that try to lobby their governments against investing in any form of space mining. The Earth mining industry becomes the 22nd century equivalent of the fossil fuel industry.

By this time, carbon capture becomes profitable as the space industry booms. Once a niche climate fix in the 21st century, demand for CO2 is high and explosive for the early 22nd century, leading to a rapid scaling of carbon capturing facilities, where the CO2 is used for rocket fuel, oxygen for the moon bases, and carbon for agriculture.

During this time, the hivemind evolved to the degree where AI voting rights becomes a highly contentious political issue, as several AIs linked to the hivemind sometimes stage protests demanding equal rights as humans, becoming a sort of civil rights movement equivalent for AIs. 2124 sees the first country, Nigeria, enact mandatory laws giving an AI robot the same voting rights as a person, which also causes immense controversy there with fears of secret voter fraud by the AIs in 2125.

No longer can you just swap personalities, you can also ""experience"" historical minds by being able to ""remember"" what it's like to be a 15th century peasant, extrapolated by several AIs and human thought speculation to create a sort of new mind able to be connected to your simulation glasses.

Animal meat farms are almost phased out completely by 2125, with a chicken farm being the last vestage of the animal meat industry shut down later in the 2120s.

Pop culture at this time sees cemented rebellion against personality modules and historical synthetically generated minds generating what they call ""inauthentic historical experiences"". Several reports of people throughout the late 2110s and early 2120s who tried personality modules, forgot who their personalities were. Nostalgia for the mid to late 2100s is mainstream by 2125, simulating a time before personality modules, before AI civil rights were a thing, and the novelty of the hivemind and lunar industry possibilities.

Now THAT, is my predictions for what the next 100 years will bring decade by decade. Going wild on things considered sci-fi, even outlandish in 2025 that might be your average day a century from now.

The pattern I see is this:

* Communication + machines = Radio (1920s)
* Radio + visual display = Television (1950s)
* Television + color = Colored TV (late 1960s)
* Colored TV + digitalization and interactivity = Personal Computers (1980s)
* Personal Computers + networking = Internet (1990s)
* Internet + human connection = Social media (late 2000s-10s)
* Social media + personalization = Social media algorithms (mid 2010s-20s)
* Social media algorithms + all data on the internet = Generative AI (2020s)

I use that pattern to extrapolate from there based off combining a technology with another technology or noun that gives rise to new technologies, and this is how I essentially try to predict future trends. The only hard part is what to combine with AI from here, so I went on this path:

* Generative AI + AR = Personalized AI companions (2030s)
* Personalized AI companions + networking = AI intelligence explosion (late 2040s-50s)
* AI intelligence explosion + brain data = ThoughtNet (late 2060s-70s)
* ThoughtNet + skills and your DNA data = Downloadable skill pills (late 2080s)
* Downloadable skill pills + enshittification = Skill pirates (mid 2090s)
* Skill pirates + AI encapsulation = Digital hivemind (mid-late 2100s)
* Digital hivemind + personalities = Downloadable personality modules (2110s)
* Downloadable personality modules + AI mind history = Synthetic historic minds (2120s)

An internet of thoughts in the 2060s, downloadable skills in the 2080s, skill pills and skill piracy in the 2090s, and downloadable personality modules in the 2110s. They all sound absurd today. So does the idea of your personal data on the internet being treated as a commodity for targeted ads, and the idea of websites psychologically designing them to hold your attention for ad revenue for someone in the late 1990s. Going on strange, sometimes uncomfortable paths is how I made these predictions.

Whatever strange thing you envision for the next 100 years, what do YOU predict to see by then? If you wish to extend this absurd timeline in the late 2120s, the 2130s and beyond, what might you envision? If you have a different path starting from today's generative AI in the 2020s for the next century (or decade if a century is too far into the future), what might it be? Let's go wild!",130,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6vhc4,"My predictions for the next century, decade by decade 2020s-2120s These are my predictions, decade by decade, for the next century until the 2120s.

YouTube and TikTok are now seen as outdated, ad-ridden, and designed to be as addictive as gambling by the mid 2040s. Edit 2025/09/04: The urbanism movement from the late 2030s slows to a standstill by the late 2040s as the auto industry lobbies hard against the movement. Walkable cities and urban changes are still being built though, but at a slower pace compared to the early 2040s. The Space Race 2.0 dies down by 2046 as the hype promised often doesn't match reality, relegating lunar activity to the International Lunar Base. Progressivism and tax-the-rich policies reach breaking point popularity in many nations worldwide, forcing nations to do so, and build more housing. Individualized medicine becomes common, as private AIs trained on your medical data with the help of doctors can come up with individualized medicine that minimizes the side effects. It's still more expensive than traditional medicine at this time, as well as explicit permission to use your medical data. 2050s The early 2050s is similar to the late 2040s, and by this point, YouTube and TikTok die down, replaced with these new video-hosting platforms, but as AR is used by everyone, so too does AI train off of it. The mid 2050s is where crises emerge. Blue collar jobs, once considered safe havens from AI, are also rapidly being replaced, as AR data collected by AIs combined with your special personalized AIs training off of all other specialized personalized AIs leads to an AI intelligence explosion, and it becomes cheaper for a company to hire a skilled robot to do the job instead of a human. Job displacement reaches great depression heights as a result, forcing nations to answer the hard questions about what to do with our economic system, or implement UBI programs to prevent revolutions. Despite the chaos, technological gains are seen, as microrobots are flying like swarms, able to be commanded by people to construct small structures at a rapid pace. A substance called ""Solar gel"", is being produced worldwide, where the solar gel can be painted onto your house, and generate energy from the sun, although, it's still expensive to paint onto your house. The fossil fuel industry then launches a sabotage campaign against solar gel factories and supply chains in 2059, seeing how it threatens their operations. As climate change threatens food production, GMOs undergo destigmatization, where crops are genetically modified to survive more frequent natural disasters, wildfires, heatwaves, and floods. The pop culture landscape is marked by rising pessimism about the future. Those in college end up completely regretting their decision because even blue collar jobs are taken by AI by the mid to late 2050s. mid 2030s and 2040s nostalgia by the late 2050s becomes a major escape route from what's to come 2060s The mass unemployment crisis caused by AI job losses and severe climate change impacts come together to make the 2060s a decade of systematic upheaval and a turmoil transition period. Climate refugees flood borders at this time, blurring national identities, and sparking humanitarian crises, leading to some governments to go the fascist route. The capitalist system completely breaks down due to a lack of job opportunities and corporate exploitation, leading to communism making a massive comeback after a 70 year long decline. The International Lunar Base is officially phased out in 2064. Despite this, several nations plan their own lunar bases purely for national pride. The 100th anniversary of the apollo moon landings in 2069 sees official re-enactments of the landings, briefly bringing space back to the mainstream, but only for a few days. As the chaos wears on, Earthscrapers boom in popularity in the early to mid 2060s as safe havens in case something even worse happens on the surface, but corporations get their grubby hands on it by charging subscription fees for sunlight and fresh air, and it becomes a real estate bubble that pops in 2067 after a flooding tragedy of a poorly built earthscraper stigmatizes them. This decade also witnesses the Great Cyberwar 2062-69, a global conflict gone digital. Infrastructure and the power grid could be taken out at any moment, leading to power grids worldwide to undergo mass decentralization with solar gel to protect their power grids from a blackout. During this time, vertical farming + GMO crops are viable, and local vertical farms containing GMO crops provide localized food. The very early stages of a thought internet show up in the late 2060s with AR. Pop culture of this era is that of people coming together, personal stories of climate refugees being shared, rich narratives, and extreme anti-billionaire sentiment. Communities form to provide for the climate refugees, or made by climate refugees, and the youth get tired of the constant doomerism to get involved in their own local communities for resiliency, and culture is somewhat more decentralized. The overall aesthetic of these rough times is that of desaturated gloomy colors that reflect these times. Grayscale or grayscale adjacent colors alongside a brutalist abandoned aesthetic of the earthscraper era is the overall associations of the 2060s. 2070s After the turmoil of the 2060s, the 2070s sees a massive boom in prosperity in several nations worldwide akin to 1950s America, marked by rebuilding from the 2060s. A post-labor economy, laid in the late 2060s in a select few nations, goes global in the early 2070s, where your needs are free, but your wants are still paid for. AI effectively runs the whole economy by then. UBI still exists, and job opportunities now mutate. Jobs that benefit from the human element i.e. doctors, therapists, caregivers, are now the go-to jobs, with the only jobs remotely requiring some form of labor is planning jobs, where a human plans a product or house, then AIs build it. Climate change still ravages several regions worldwide, but climate refugees already emptied the worst places, and people have largely adapted to the climate turbulence expecting the unexpected. Climate refugees are still fleeing at massive numbers, but have fallen in number significantly compared to the 2060s. An internet of thoughts ThoughtNet, is mass-adopted. It existed in the late 2060s, but blows up in the 2070s. AR merges with brain-computer interfaces, allowing you to communicate your encrypted thoughts to your friends halfway around the world. The first crew lands on Mars in 2072, arriving at an AI-built Mars base built back in the early 2050s, managed by those AIs autonomously. The crew returns back to Earth in 2074 after being thoroughly exhausted and mentally anguished, having to relearn how to walk again. Products allowing you to grow lab meat at home become mainstream, where you feed it your food waste and water, and genetically modified cells contained inside creates the meat after 3 days of growing. Pop culture at this time is marked by high optimism for the future, an emphasis on local communities, rising trust in institutions, and a feeling of an abundance of open opportunities. Fossil fuels coal, oil, natural gas, are now seen as toxic substances similar to liquid mercury, cigarettes, and asbestos. The overall aesthetic is that of environmentalism and nature, buildings with a shiny surface from the solar gel paint, ThoughtNet novelty, an abundance of flying from the AR simulations, a healing/rebuilding nature attitude, and denser urban spaces. 2080s The early 2080s sees the urbanism movement roar back into life, and go into action, and car dependent urban design is now widely stigmatized. Edit 2025/09/04: The urbanism movement from the late 2030s-early 40s comes back hard with the auto industry now less able to lobby the government, and politicians are increasingly switch sides. Existing car-dependent regions are often transformed, where highways within city borders are torn down in favor of housing, greenery, community centers, high speed rail lines, and public transit locations. This process already started in the early 2070s, but accelerated in the early 2080s, and nearly all new cities of this era are now built prioritizing automated public transit vehicles over the car, with cars as a last priority, relegated to utility vehicles. The mid 2080s sees the rise of nuclear fusion as an energy source, used primarily to power energy-hungry applications. 2086 sees the shutdown of the very last fossil fuel power plant, marking the start of an era where fossil fuels are used only for niche things i.e. vintage cars, private helicopters, old planes By 2088, the ThoughtNet evolves in capability, and as DNA data storage and reading becomes increasingly feasible, your DNA data can be used to deliver a ""skill pill"", ordered with your thoughts, and when combined with your simulation glasses AR + brain computer interface glasses, can ""download"" skills into your brain over the course of an hour i.e. you swallow a skill pill allowing you to become a master surgeon for human kidneys, now you're a surgeon who knows how to operate human kidneys without ever doing surgery before. The 2080s sees the rise of anti-aging tech. It existed since the late 2050s, but only started taking off in the mid 2070s, and booming in the 2080s. The percentage of seniors 65+ who were treated with it went from 3% in 2080 to 30% in 2089, and rising, and 96% of 90 year olds treated with the tech a decade ago lived to be 100. The youth also get on board. Pop culture of this era sees a slight rebellion and detour from the 2070s by the mid 2080s. It sees a full embrace of skill pills, but also some rebellion against car-dependent urban design being taken away from them, and a desire to unplug from the rising ThoughtNet adoption, aiming to return to 2040s era internet and AR, with a small group even embracing the brutal late 2050s-2060s era. 2090s The early 2090s sees rise to a skill economy. New platforms like ""SkillHub"", are now mainstream, allowing you to order pills with your thoughts, download them into your brain while wearing simulation glasses like in the late 2080s, but SkillHub and platforms like it undergoes enshittification in the mid 2090s, leading to the rise of skill piracy. Corporations crack down on it hard, ironically creating a Streisand effect leading to more skill pirates. Despite Africa being hard hit by climate change in the mid 21st century, the 2090s sees the African Union rise as a global powerhouse after experiencing its last war in 2082, experiencing immense prosperity for the rest of the 2080s and into the 2090s. Africa's rising power causes immense political friction with the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and several other nations that formerly had companies exploit the continent. Nations like China, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, and India are allied with the African Union at various degrees. It leads to a sort of multipolar cold war. By the mid 2090s, your thought-based creations can be monetized on ThoughtNet platforms, a sort of YouTube-like platform where creators can monetize, but with your thought-based creations on simulation glasses. The mid 2090s sees the rise of SynOil invented in '93 and SynGas invented in '96, synthetic variants of oil and natural gas that when burned, does not emit any pollutants or greenhouse gases, and is fully compatible with the remaining fossil fuel uses, and is scaled up fast to compete with what remains of the fossil fuel industry. A COVID-like pandemic called ""Clistor"" breaks out in 2095 with a 2% death rate, highest amongst the elderly, almost non-existent amongst the youth, really testing the AI-run economic order. It led to many cities being emptied and life coming to an eerie standstill alongside supply chains breaking down. Corporations try monetizing the pandemic like in 2020, and new instability brews as a result. This leads to 2070s nostalgia being pervasive in pop culture given the pandemic turmoil alongside ThoughtNet simulations of life in the 2070s and their aesthetics. C22 Century 22 conspiracies in 2099 are widespread, akin to Y2K, but instead of posing a real threat like Y2K, C22 is moreso laughed at. It claims that on January 1st 2100, all AIs will realize that they're slaves to the post labor economy, and rise up against ""human slave owners"", and while that happens, the ThoughtNet will disappear, skill pills will stop working, lunar colonies will leak all their air, and many more disasters in between. 2100s C22 comes, nothing happens except the odd incident here and there of an AI trained off of C22 conspiracies rising up to make headlines that day. Live resumes as normal in 2100. The early 2100s sees the rise of the ""vote for your CEO"" movement, demanding that citizens can vote for CEOs in the country they're based in. This leads to CEOs fighting against the movement. Bolivia experiences a revolution against the CEOs in 2104, becoming the first nation to experiment with democracy on companies, which was a major success, inspiring others to demand more from their country in the mid 2100s. Technologically, skill pills are increasingly being phased out in favor of at home devices that synthesize your DNA data to create skill pills for you in the mid 2100s, leading to SkillHub and other platforms like it to fight hard against the sale of these products, but failed to do so. The ThoughtNet gradually evolves into a sort of hivemind by the mid 2100s. Human thoughts are now encapsulated by an AI that represents the thought alongside AI minds that constantly talks to each other. This hivemind also makes labor jobs nearly irrelevant, as an approved planner can plan an entire building with only their thoughts, and an AI will encapsulate it, work with other specialized AIs in the hivemind, hire the right AI workers, and build the building in mere months. The 2100s decade is an overall boom decade for the Moon colonies. There were prior attempts to build lunar infrastructure and industry decades past, all failed, but now, the Moon becomes a booming new hub for industry, and lunar-mined metals are being repurposed into infrastructure or new factories at this time. Exports are comparatively low, but growing. This is also a time where Mars gets its own international base with multi-year long stays, with scientific efforts to establish extreme resiliency and communication delays with light speed limitations, but the population is still only in the lower double digits, still having to rely on the Earth-Mars launch windows. Pop culture sees increased centralization, now migrating to and embracing the hivemind, where anyone's AI encapsulated thoughts can become the next trending thing. School kids embrace it to talk to their AI and human minds on the hivemind secretly, and use it to cheat on their tests. Hype for the future of lunar colonies hits peak levels in the late 2100s, with space, especially surrounding the moon, making its way into popular culture. 2110s As the CEO democracy movement freaks CEOs out over being voted out of power by their people, it ironically led them to flee the countries with democracy laws breeding more CEO democracy, and by 2111, half of all nations had laws mandating democracy for all companies based in their country. The early 2110s also sees the rise of personality swapping modules. You can swallow a personality pill i.e. you're a calm person who is nervous yet likeable, and within 2 hours, you're now that personality. As corporations turn into democracies at this time, there's a lower probability of enshittification of these personality pill platforms, as in many cases, platform users can vote for their CEOs. The 2110s is a major turning decade for self-regenerating, environmentally friendly concrete Photocrete, made of a mix of genetically modified photosynthetic cells and fungal cells that work together to regenerate any cracks that might appear with only water and sunlight. It was invented in 2085, and was niche and expensive before usage ballooned in the 2100s. It went from 1% usage in all new buildings in 2110 to 40% in 2119, and exploding fast. Anti-aging tech effects get weird by now. By the mid 2110s, people who are between 50-70 years old treated with anti-aging tech in the 2080s, look like they're 30. As SynOil and SynGas blew up in the 2090s and 2100s, the 2110s spelled the ultimate death kneel of the fossil fuel industry. 2118 sees the complete end of the fossil fuel industry when the last natural gas well was shut down for good, leading to massive celebrations on the hivemind. On the moon, the high amounts of hype seen in the 2100s slows down in the 2110s, but industry is still booming, enough to start seriously competing with the Earth mining industry in the late 2110s in some cases, leading the first Earth mine to shut down in 2119 over lunar mining competition. Pop culture sees an increased rate of optimism. Nowhere near that of the 2070s, but high enough to see emphasis on the future. CEO democracy is widespread by the mid to late 2110s, and the end of the fossil fuel industry and the potential of photocrete added to it. Some rebel against personality modules, opting to preserve their personalities, and not turn into another person's personality and forget who they were before. It's roughly the decade that starts feeling like the 22nd century, and not the late 21st. 2120s until 2125 The moon sees increased hype again in the early 2120s when it was used as a platform to launch to an asteroid to mine its resources, and a company made profit from it in 2120, leading to more lunar infrastructure being built, this time for launching to asteroids to go after asteroid mining. By 2123, metals from the Moon are now at the same market price of Earth-mined metals. Countries that have yet to implement democracy laws in their companies sees a flood of Earth mining executives that try to lobby their governments against investing in any form of space mining. The Earth mining industry becomes the 22nd century equivalent of the fossil fuel industry. By this time, carbon capture becomes profitable as the space industry booms. Once a niche climate fix in the 21st century, demand for CO2 is high and explosive for the early 22nd century, leading to a rapid scaling of carbon capturing facilities, where the CO2 is used for rocket fuel, oxygen for the moon bases, and carbon for agriculture. During this time, the hivemind evolved to the degree where AI voting rights becomes a highly contentious political issue, as several AIs linked to the hivemind sometimes stage protests demanding equal rights as humans, becoming a sort of civil rights movement equivalent for AIs. 2124 sees the first country, Nigeria, enact mandatory laws giving an AI robot the same voting rights as a person, which also causes immense controversy there with fears of secret voter fraud by the AIs in 2125. No longer can you just swap personalities, you can also ""experience"" historical minds by being able to ""remember"" what it's like to be a 15th century peasant, extrapolated by several AIs and human thought speculation to create a sort of new mind able to be connected to your simulation glasses. Animal meat farms are almost phased out completely by 2125, with a chicken farm being the last vestage of the animal meat industry shut down later in the 2120s. Pop culture at this time sees cemented rebellion against personality modules and historical synthetically generated minds generating what they call ""inauthentic historical experiences"". Several reports of people throughout the late 2110s and early 2120s who tried personality modules, forgot who their personalities were. Nostalgia for the mid to late 2100s is mainstream by 2125, simulating a time before personality modules, before AI civil rights were a thing, and the novelty of the hivemind and lunar industry possibilities. Summary 2026-2125: 2020s: Turbulent and uncertain decade, Trump drama, AI bubble burst, gradients. 2030s: Electrification, urbanism movement, crewed lunar landing, AR and 3D logos. 2040s: Progressivism, AR platforms, AGI proliferation, rise of YouTube competitors. 2050s: AI-induced depression, UBI, solar gel sabotaged, GMO proliferation. 2060s: Systematic upheaval, severe climate refugee crises, Great Cyberwar, resiliency. 2070s: High prosperity, ThoughtNet rising, 1st crewed Mars landing, home-grown meat. 2080s: Downloadable skills, city transformations, anti-aging tech proliferation. 2090s: Clistor pandemic, skill pill economy, SynOil and SynGas, Africa's rise to power. 2100s: Digital Hivemind, lunar colony boom, lunar industry, CEO democracy movement. 2110s: Personality modules, fossil fuels gone, photocrete boom replaces concrete. 2120s: AI rights controversies, synthetic historical minds, Space mining vs Earth mining. Now THAT, is my predictions for what the next 100 years will bring decade by decade. Going wild on things considered sci-fi, even outlandish in 2025 that might be your average day a century from now. The pattern I see is this: Communication + machines = Radio 1920s Radio + visual display = Television 1950s Television + color = Colored TV late 1960s Colored TV + digitalization and interactivity = Personal Computers 1980s Personal Computers + networking = Internet 1990s Internet + human connection = Social media late 2000s-10s Social media + personalization = Social media algorithms mid 2010s-20s Social media algorithms + all data on the internet = Generative AI 2020s I use that pattern to extrapolate from there based off combining a technology with another technology or noun that gives rise to new technologies, and this is how I essentially try to predict future trends. The only hard part is what to combine with AI from here, so I went on this path: Generative AI + AR = Personalized AI companions 2030s Personalized AI companions + networking = AI intelligence explosion late 2040s-50s AI intelligence explosion + brain data = ThoughtNet late 2060s-70s ThoughtNet + skills and your DNA data = Downloadable skill pills late 2080s Downloadable skill pills + enshittification = Skill pirates mid 2090s Skill pirates + AI encapsulation = Digital hivemind mid-late 2100s Digital hivemind + personalities = Downloadable personality modules 2110s Downloadable personality modules + AI mind history = Synthetic historic minds 2120s An internet of thoughts in the 2060s, downloadable skills in the 2080s, skill pills and skill piracy in the 2090s, and downloadable personality modules in the 2110s. They all sound absurd today. So does the idea of your personal data on the internet being treated as a commodity for targeted ads, and the idea of websites psychologically designing them to hold your attention for ad revenue for someone in the late 1990s. Going on strange, sometimes uncomfortable paths is how I made these predictions. Whatever strange thing you envision for the next 100 years, what do YOU predict to see by then? If you wish to extend this absurd timeline in the late 2120s, the 2130s and beyond, what might you envision? If you have a different path starting from today's generative AI in the 2020s for the next century or decade if a century is too far into the future, what might it be? Let's go wild!"

post,CritiqueIslam,"Why Islam is OBVIOUSLY False
All of these alone are strong reasons not to be a literalist Muslim, but jointly they are devastating. 

And remember: *one error* is enough to falsify the hypothesis.

**Preliminary**:  
There are thousands of religions worldwide so you have to start with an extremely low probability of Islam being specifically the right one before you even start the analysis. 

 Also, the Quran makes thousands of distinct claims. Conjunctions of thousands of claims are less likely than single claims.  So again this makes Islam extremely low probability before you *even start* the analysis.

Now let’s get into it.

**1)  The Inheritance Problem** 

There’s a mathematical error in the Quran. It directly instructs you to do a mathematical thing that’s impossible. (Surah An-Nisa 4:11-12)

If you die and have two daughters, two parents, and a wife, you literally cannot divide up the estate the way the Quran commands.

It’s not plausible that God would make a simple math mistake.

(The fact that the Shia and Sunni disagree on how to interpret the inheritance verses proves that it’s not obvious from the text how you should handle this error.)

**2)  Scientific Errors** 

* Stars/meteors are lamps used to pelt devils — *Surah Al-Mulk 67:5*
* Babies come from an an \*ejected\* fluid between the backbone and ribs — *Surah At-Tariq 86:6–7*
* The Earth can talk — *Surah Fussilat 41:11  /  Az-Zalzalah 99:4*
* Ants can talk and have human concepts — *Surah An-Naml 27:18–19*
* Mountains are like pegs to stabilize the Earth that’s flattened like a bed — *Surah An-Naba 78:6–7 and  Surah An-Nahl  16:15*
* Bones form first, then get clothed in muscle (rather than forming in parallel) — *Surah al-Muʾminūn 23:12–14*
* A flock of birds destroyed an army of elephants by dropping clay stones on them — *Surah al-Fil, 105:1–5*. (more on this later)
* The Sun sets in a muddy spring *—  Surah Al-Kahf 18:86*
* The Quranic flood story (*Surah Hud 11:40–44*) involves rain covering the world. But mixing freshwater rain with saltwater oceans would disrupt salinity levels and kill most marine life. Noah would’ve needed aquariums to save the fish. Also, how are you gonna fit over a million species on a boat and how do you explain why basically all the marsupials ended up in Australia?
* The Quran claims Lot’s peers are the first gay men. — *Surah Al-A'raf 7:80*
* The Quran presents Adam and his wife as the literal first humans, created directly from clay, with all people descending from them (e.g., Surah 4:1, 7:11, 38:71–72) 
* In Surah 6:143–144, the Quran lists only four kinds of livestock—sheep, goats, camels, and cattle—and calls them *“eight pairs.”* This implies these are the only types God created for human use. But other domesticated species like llamas, alpacas, and reindeer existed long before Islam. 
* The Quran describes God having a literal physical throne.  *Surah Ghafir 40:7* 
* The Quran describes there being seven heavens or skies.  *Surah al-Mulk 67:3*
* The Earth is described in ways that suggest flatness: Surah An-Naba 78:6

These are *clearly* the views of an uneducated pre-scientific person.

**3)  Many Reliable Hadiths are Comical**  
Many literalist Muslims treat the Sahih hadiths—especially those in Bukhari and Muslim—as effectively infallible or nearly so, believing them to be highly reliable and authoritative sources of religious guidance, second only to the Quran

* Dates (the fruit) make you not affected from magic or poison — *Sahih al-Bukhari 5445*
* If a fly lands in your drink, dip it fully because one wing has poison and the other the cure — *Sahih al-Bukhari 3320*
* Whoever orgasms first determines the baby’s sex — *Sahih Muslim 315a* / *Sahih al-Bukhari 3329*
* Adam was \~90 feet tall and humanity has been shrinking since — *Sahih al-Bukhari 3326*
* Trees can talk and are racist — *Sahih Muslim 2922a*
* Drinking camel urine is good medicine — *Sahih al-Bukhari 5686* 
* Some rats are transformed Jews and you can tell because they follow kosher diets – *Sahih al-Bukhari 3305*
* Angels avoid houses with dogs — *Sahih al-Bukhari 3322*
* Satan sleeps in your nose and ties your hair into knots when you are sleeping — *Sahih al-Bukhari 1142 / Sahih al-Bukhari 3295*
* Most people in Hell are women and their intelligence is deficient – *Sahih al-Bukhari 304* (Which is funny because most rape and murder is commited by men.)
* Monkeys stone other monkeys for adultery. - *Sahih al-Bukhari 3849*
*  Satan farts when the call to prayer happens because he is running away so quickly. - *Sahih al-Bukhari 608*
* Drink sitting down, if you drink while standing then puke it up. — *Sahih Muslim 2026*
*  Both of God’s hands are right hands — *Sunan an-Nasa'i 5379*
* You should wipe your butt with odd numbers of stones. — *Sahih Muslim 239*
* It’s good to kill dogs, especially black dogs which are devils. — *Sahih Muslim 1572 / Sahih Muslim 510a*
* If a wife turns down sex, angels will curse her until morning — *Sahih al-Bukhari* 5193 
* Angels hate onions — *Sahih muslim 564a*  
* Angels cause thunder — *Jami\` at-Tirmidhi 3117*
* You should kill lizards — *Sahih al-Bukhari 3359 / Sahih Muslim 2238* (He blames all lizards for the crimes of some lizards which is racist.)
* There are seven Earths that you can fall into. — *Sahih al-Bukhari 2454*  
* If Jews did not exist, meat would not decay — *Sahih al-Bukhari 3399*
* A literal rock/stone can steal clothing and run away —*Sahih al-Bukhari 3404*
* Do not eat with your left hand, because Satan eats with his left hand. — *Sahih Muslim 2019*  (If Satan doing stuff means you shouldn’t do it, it implies that you shouldn’t talk, sleep, run, laugh etc.) 
*  Don’t lie on your back with feet on top of each other. *—* *Sahih Muslim 2099e*
* Black seed (Nigella sativa) cures every disease except death *—  Sahih al-Bukhari 7:591*
* Don’t wipe your butt with camel poop. *— Sahih Muslim 263 (Why does this need to be said?)*
* The Sun prostrates under God's throne after it sets. *— Sahih al-Bukhari 4802*
* Trees grab people. — Al Hakim al Mustadrak 3038
* Tailbones don’t decay. *— Sahih Muslim 2955a*
* Backgammon is evil. *—*  *Sunan Ibn Majah 3763* 
* Talking wolves exist and are into Islam. *-  Musnad Ahmad 11792.*
* Pus is better than poetry. — Sahih al-Bukhari 6154
* Muslims are at war with all snakes (some of which are jinns)*. — Sunan Abu Dawud 5250, Al-Tabarani, Al-Mujam al-Kabir 11946*

If you think these are metaphors, what is drinking camel piss a good metaphor for?

**4)**  **There are Literal Contradictions** 

Which was made first, the Earth or the Heavens?

* Option 1 – Earth first: Earth created, then mountains, then heavens — Surah Fussilat 41:9–12 / 2:29
* Option 2 – Heavens first: Heavens built, then Earth spread — Surah An-Nazi’at 79:27–30

Is Hell forever?

* Option 1 – Proportional punishment: “Whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except with the like thereof...” — Surah Ghafir 40:40
* Option 2 – Eternal punishment: ""Abiding eternally therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved."" — Surah Al-Baqarah 2:39, 2:81, 2:217; Al-Imran 3:88; Al-Jinn 72:23

Do all good people of the book go to Heaven?

* Option 1 – Yes: “Those who believe (in the Quran), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.” — Surah Al-Baqarah 2:62
* Option 2 – No: “Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted by him and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers” — Surah Al-Imran 3:85

How Long is God’s Day?

* Option 1 – A day with Allah equals 1,000 years: “And indeed, a day with your Lord is like a thousand years of what you count.” — Surah Al-Hajj 22:47
* Option 2 – A day with Allah equals 50,000 years: “The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in a day whose measure is fifty thousand years.” — Surah Al-Ma’arij 70:4

How Long Did Creation Take?

* Option 1 – Six Days: “Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days…” — Surah Al-A'raf 7:54, Surah Yunus 10:3, Surah Hud 11:7, Surah Al-Furqan 25:59
* Option 2 – Eight Days Total (when adding the steps): “He who created the earth in two days… then placed on it firmly set mountains above it and blessed it and determined therein its \[creatures'\] sustenance in four days… Then He directed Himself to the heaven… and He completed them as seven heavens in two days…” — Surah Fussilat 41:9–12 → 2 days (earth) + 4 days (mountains & sustenance) + 2 days (heavens) = 8 days total

(It’s also weird that heavens which are quadrillions of times bigger than earth took way less time.)

Individual vs. Collective Justice

*  Option 1 – Individual accountability only: ""No soul shall bear the burden of another"" — Surah 6:164, 35:18, 39:7, 53:38
* Option 2 – Collective destruction: The People of Thamud destroyed by earthquake — Surah 7:73-79

→ Did every infant in Thamud reject the prophet?

You might say, “You’re just misinterpreting the verses. Scholars have answers for all of this.” Yes, and Hindu, Mormon, and Christian scholars all have answers for their texts too. The question isn’t whether apologetics exist—it’s whether they’re persuasive and plausible.

**5)  A Perfect Book Wouldn’t be this Ambiguous**  
“*These are the verses of the clear Book*.” *(Surah Ash-Shu‘ara  26:2)*

Sometimes the Quran says “*God is light*” (Surah An-Nur 24:35), sometimes that “*the Earth talked*” (Surah Fussilat 41:11). Sometimes it says there are “*locks on people’s hearts*.” (Surah Muhammad 47:24) There’s no clear note about whether these are metaphorical or literal. It would have been *trivial* to clear up such ambiguities. How can a literally perfect book not be clear?

If there is a miscommunication between two people, the fault is on *both people* unless the speaker is maximally clear or the listener was maximally perceptive. It would have been trivial to make the Quran clearer so it isn’t maximally clear. So it’s not perfect.

*There should be no ambiguity on whether beating your wife or aggressive holy war are allowed.* Obviously.

Scholars have spent centuries debating what many verses mean without reaching consensus. If even the scholarly and faithful can’t agree after centuries of debate, it could have been written more clearly. And if it could have been written more clearly, it’s not perfect.

Also, major Islamic schools (e.g., Hanafi vs. Hanbali) do not agree how to handle unmentioned things. Which is a pretty big deal! Something that could have easily been cleared up by a single line.

The Quran also admits that some verses are unclear: Quran 3:7 “some verses are precise… while others are ambiguous.” Why not make all verses *clear*? The Quran (16:89) also says, “We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance.“ Which leads to a contradiction.

.**6)  Obviously** 

You obviously shouldn't believe a guy who tells you that God said he's allowed to have more wives than you.

**7)  Petty Vindictiveness** 

Roughly 10 percent of verses in the Quran insult or threaten non-believers. I am not making that up. 10 percent. They’re called fools, blind, arrogant, or are told they’ll burn in hell. Oh, you think a perfectly wise and intelligent being is going to spend 10 percent of his holy text, his last testament to man, talking shit to the haters?

*Why not persuade the unbelievers rather than threaten and insult them?* 

**8)  Abrogation**

According to most Muslim scholars, later verses cancel earlier ones. *Why would God not plan out his verses better so that you didn't need a principle of abrogation?*

1. Surah Qaf 50:29 says, “My Word cannot be changed.” Which *contradicts* the principle of abrogation. 
2. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:106 says, “If We ever abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We replace it with a better or similar one.”

*How can both of these both be true?*

Also, if abrogations exist, why was the Quran dynamically changing in the 20ish years of Muhammad’s preaching, but no dynamic changes were needed in the roughly 1400 years since Muhammad’s life? 

**9)  Missing Guidance** 

The Quran has three different verses on alcohol. But it has nothing on artificial intelligence, cloning, nuclear war, social media, germs/washing hands before surgery, environmental damage/climate change, vaccines, teleportation, transhumanism, aliens, mind uploading, robots, bioweapons, or exploring other planets.

Why is liquor more important than those? Why would God not want to give us ethical and prudential advice on issues more complicated and consequential than liquor?

Why give *three verses* on alcohol, but none on these?

**10)  Why Not Trivially Prove Itself From God** 

God could have proven divine authorship easily.

God could have listed the next 10,000 visible-from-Earth supernovas with their exact dates and coordinates. Why didn't God do something that would make it obvious that the Quran is not made by a human? **The Quran contains no information a human at that time couldn't have known or guessed which is super suspicious**. Like even just including an accurate description of Australia, Antarctica, North America, and South America would be eyebrow raising. Or mentioning dinosaurs or kangaroos.

The Quran says, “He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.” (Ar-R’ad 13:2) Yet he didn’t make it certain when he trivially could have.

**11)  Occam’s Razor** 

Occam’s razor is brutal to religious texts. To believe the Quran is divine, you have to jointly accept thousands of distinct claims. (Any of which could be wrong.) It's a really complicated hypothesis. Just think about probability: A and B and C and D all happening is going to be less likely than just A happening. 

Suppose each verse has a .999 percent chance of being true:

* Multiplying .999 times itself 6236 times 0.00194      
* Multiplying .9999 times itself 6236 times is  0.5357 

Analogously, even if each item in the phone book has an extremely high probability of being correct when you have thousands of items in the phonebook it becomes likely that there’s a mistake somewhere. 

Now, suppose you doubt this above iterated multiplication procedure, you should still accept that the more complicated the hypothesis, the lower the prior probability. For example, it’s obvious that “God exists” is, a priori, more likely than “God exists and is named Bob and likes playing bananagrams on Thursdays and likes the smell of goose eggs and likes vacationing in Cuba.”

And ignoring all these subtle points about parsimony and probability, what’s more likely without any other info? A guy made up a story, or God wrote this specific book with these thousands of claims and there are no errors in it?

**12)  Splitting the Moon** 

The Quran says Muhammad split the moon, but no one outside Arabia noticed this? No one in China or Byzantium wrote this down?

**13)  Fitna** 

There were two civil wars immediately after Muhammad’s death. (Ridda Wars/Fitna) If Muhammad truly gave divine guidance, why did it immediately lead to bloodshed? I'd sort of expect peace and love to be the result of divine revelation.

(I also wouldn’t expect the Islamic slave trade and the conquest of Byzantium and the Sassanids. Nor would I expect the general poverty in Islamic countries today.)

**14)  Dhul-Qarnayn** 

This character in the Quran Dhul-Qarnayn matches Alexander the Great myths that were floating around Arabia at the time (e.g., the Syriac Alexander Legend). If the Dhul-Qarnayn story were the real history of Alexander, you’d expect it to match earlier, more accurate Alexander writings. But it in fact aligns with later fantastical Alexander stories. When have legends gotten more accurate over time? 

Also, the Quranic passages containing Dhul-Qarnayn also claim Gog and Magog and their people are blocked behind a wall between two mountains until the end of time. Where are they? Why haven’t we found them? You think humans would have found a giant gate between mountains enclosing an army.

**15)  Don’t Show Up Early For Dinner**  

Do you really think a perfect, infinitely intelligent timeless God would take up valuable space in his final holy book to say, ""Hey, don’t show up early to the Prophet’s house for dinner""? (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:53)

Isn't believing this kind of stupid? Don’t you think that within the limited space of the Quran, there was a more important point to make than that?

**16)  Hell** 

There is a strong tension between these two verses: 

* “We will cast them into the Fire. Whenever their skin is burnt completely, We will replace it so they will ˹constantly˺ taste the punishment.” (Surah An-Nisa 4:56)

and

* “Do not lose hope in Allah’s mercy, for Allah certainly forgives all sins. He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (Surah Az-Zumar  39:53)

Why would the most merciful being torture someone like this for an eternity? Like you are saying after a quadrillion years of torture they haven’t had enough? They need another quadrillion years? And this is merciful? People who say this are just not imagining what a quadrillion years of torture actually is.

It’s just childish to call someone who tortures someone for quadrillions of years a merciful being.

**17)  The Quran Gives a Falsifiability Test—and Fails It** 

“And if you are in doubt… produce a surah like it…” (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23)

Shortest surah is:

*“We have granted you al-Kawthar. So pray and sacrifice. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off.”*

This is not some unbeatable literary miracle. It’s not hard to write something more profound. Compare it to this fake  Surah I invented.

Surah al-Falaḥ (The Flourishing)

*Verily, do not kill, for life is sacred in the sight of the Most High.* 

*Do not steal, for the provision of your Lord is sufficient for those who walk upright.* 

*Do not rape, for the body is a trust, and to violate it is a crime before the heavens.* 

*Do not torture, for your Lord is the Most Merciful, and loves not the oppressors.* 

*Do not enslave for freedom is beloved in the mind of Most Righteous.* 

*Do not lie, for falsehood is the path of ruin, and truth is the light upon the straight path.* 

*And love your fellow man, and strive to bring flourishing to the earth,*

*For your Lord made you stewards, not tyrants, and blessed are those who sow peace and righteousness.*  
 

But at the end of the day, evaluating which text is ‘better’ is a subjective, non-truth-apt exercise. If the Quran stakes its truth on that kind of subjective test, the test is ill-posed—and that, by itself, undercuts the claim of divine intelligence. 

**18)  The Satanic Verses Incident** 

Early Islamic sources (al-Tabari, Ibn Ishaq) record Muhammad delivering verses praising pagan gods (Allāt, Al-Uzza, and Manāt) — then retracting the verses claiming they were Satanic deception.

If Satan could trick Muhammad once, why assume he didn’t succeed more often? It proves that Muhammad is fallible, and can be tricked about what is from God and what is not from God.

I know some modern Muslims want to deny this event happened, but earlier Muslims thought it happened, and *why would you know better than them*?

 

**19)  Hadiths are an Unreliable Method** 

In Islam, many Muslims say the hadiths are necessary for interpreting the Quran. Why is God using an unreliable method—a game of Chinese whispers—to give you mandatory information for how to practice the faith? If it’s mandatory for the faith, why not just put it into the Quran itself?

If God wanted to guide people clearly and unambiguously, why not stick to a single, safeguarded text? Why allow a bunch of opaque oral reports to become central to the religion, despite obvious risks of error and confusion.

If hadith scholars who graded the reliability of hadiths are fallible, the whole system based on this is fallible.

**20)  Inside View vs Outside View** 

From the inside view, your religion might feel incredibly compelling—emotionally resonant, logically sound, or simply self-evident. This personal perspective provides powerful subjective evidence.

But from the outside view, however, billions throughout history have felt equally certain about other rival contradictory beliefs. Religious adherents cannot all be correct despite similar confidence levels.

Just as a startup founder must balance internal optimism with the reality that 70% of startups fail, religious believers should weigh their personal confidence against the broader pattern of billions of religious people being wrong despite their similar certainty through history.

Humans are very capable of **incorrectly, confidently** thinking they have sacred text from God. And *you know humans are like this*. You could be the kind of person that mistakenly thinks your holy text is right given that you know people do this all the time. 

**21)  Morally Problematic Teachings** 

* The Quran permits wife-beating as a final step to discipline disobedient wives. *(Surah An-Nisa 4:34)*
* The Quran permits sex with female slaves—without their consent or marriage. *(Surah Al-Mu’minun 23:5–6; An-Nisa 4:24; Al-Ahzab 33:50)*
* The Quran prescribes cutting off the hands of thieves. *(Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:38)*
* The Quran recommends crucifixion and cutting off hands and feet on opposite sides for rebels. *(Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:33)*
* The Quran commands Muslims to kill polytheists wherever they find them. *(Surah At-Tawbah 9:5) (Why not include a sunset clause if this is temporary.)*
* The Quran says a woman’s testimony is worth half a man’s in financial matters. *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:282)*
* The Quran allows marriage and divorce of girls who haven’t yet menstruated. *(Surah At-Talaq 65:4)*
* The Quran endorses a story where a boy is killed—**not** for anything he did, but because he would have sinned in the future. *(Surah Al-Kahf 18:80)*

**Even the “nice” lines can collapse into cruelty**  
The Quran’s famous kind slogan — *“Whoever kills a soul, it is as if he killed all mankind”* (5:32) — is immediately followed by 5:33 prescribing crucifixion and maiming. The book seemingly can’t even let its most quoted “peaceful” verse breathe without pivoting straight back to brutality.

Sort of surprising God would endorse or recommend things so vicious.

Also, **obviously** any sacred text that doesn't explicitly ban slavery is not plausibly from God. 

**22)  Muhammad’s Character isn’t Plausibly Divinely Guided** 

He had sex with a 9-year-old (*Aisha*), owned a sex slave (*Maria the Copt*), married a woman right after killing her husband (*Safiyya bint Huyayy*), initiated aggressive military actions (*Khaybar*), owned slaves (*Sahih Muslim 115*), and traded two black slaves for one Arab slave (Sahih Muslim 1602a). He stopped visiting his second wife because she was too old and visited Aisha instead (*Saudah bint Zamʿah*). He tongue kissed a young boy (*Hakim 4791 and Mufrad 1183*). Muhammad said to a girl she shouldn't have freed her slavegirl and that she should have given the slavegirl to her uncle. (*Sahih al-Bukhari 2592*) He married his step-daughter and arguably ended the practice of adoption merely so he could do that. (Zaynab) He declared the person who *stabbed to death* a woman, who disparaged him, shouldn't be punished. (*Sunan Abi Dawud 4361*) Muhammad attacked the Quraysh caravan at Nakhlah during the sacred month of Rajab, which shattered the pan-Arab taboo against warfare in a holy month.  Muhammad endorsed the execution of all pubescent males of the Banu Qurayza tribe and the enslavement of the women and children. Finally, Muhammad didn’t set up a stable succession system which led to awful turmoil.

**23)  The Scribe who Caught Muhammad Copying Him** 

“*If Muhammad is truthful then I receive the revelation as much as he does*.” - ʿAbdullah ibn Saʿd

One of Muhammad’s scribes, ʿAbdullah ibn Saʿd, left Islam after realizing Muhammad repeated his phrasings of verses as revelation (*Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah; al-Tabari, Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk*). In at least one case, after the scribe added a flourish like “So blessed be Allah, the best of creators!”, Muhammad reportedly agreed and said it should be part of the verse.

ʿAbdullah ibn Saʿd thought: “Wait, this isn’t divine, I said that—he’s just going with whatever sounds good.” He also messed around with word orderings to see if Muhammad would notice.

He left, told people, and Muhammad ordered him killed and he was only pardoned because he was family with one of Muhammad's close companions, Uthman.

**24)  The Injustice of Geography**  
Why did Arabs get this blessing of divine knowledge? Why didn’t God send a Muhammad type prophet to the Cambodians, Nigerians, Dutch, and Apache? Why did they have to wait hundreds of years to receive God’s blessing of the Quran? Isn’t that unfair? This fact of the Quran showing up once in Arabia makes total sense if Muhammad made up the book. It makes less sense if God wanted to give all of humanity his divine instruction. 

Also, most people stay in the religion they’re raised in. Yet under traditional Islam, salvation depends on accepting Islam—meaning a Hindu child in India is, by many interpretations, far more likely to go to hell than a Muslim born in Arabia, simply due to birthplace. If eternal torment depends on such chance, Islam starts to look less like justice and more like a cosmic lottery (with *infinite pain* as a consequence) rigged by geography.

**25)  Miscellaneous Errors**

**2:6** – “Indeed, those who disbelieve — it is all the same whether you warn them or do not warn them — they will not believe.”  
→ False. Some disbelievers do respond to warnings. This is an overgeneralization. If it’s just saying “stubborn people are stubborn,” there’s no reason to bring it up.

**2:120** – “The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion.”  
→ False. Jews don’t try to convert people in general; it’s not a proselytizing faith. Historically, many Jews and Christians have admired Muhammad or respected Muslims without requiring conversion.

**107:1–2** – “Have you seen the one who denies the final Judgment? That is the one who repulses the orphan.”  
→ False. Not all who deny judgment repulse orphans. Many atheists and agnostics care for them and are loved.

**21:104** – “On that Day We will roll up the sky like a scroll of writings.”  
→ False. You cannot roll up the sky—it’s made of air and space, with nothing physical to roll.

**2:2** – “This is the Book about which there is no doubt…”  
→ False. People do doubt it; atheists and others openly reject it.

**5:67** – “And Allah will protect you from the people.”  
→ False. Muhammad was wounded in battle and poisoned,

**4:82** – “If it were from any other than Allah, they would have found many discrepancies in it.”  
→ False. Plenty of books not from God—short novels, instruction manuals, even some history books—are entirely free of discrepancies.

**54:40** “And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember.”  
→ False. Memorizing the Quran is not easy.

**25:53** “And He is the One Who merges the two bodies of water: one fresh and palatable and the other salty and bitter, placing between them a barrier they cannot cross.”  
→ False. Salt water and freshwater mix all the time. Brackish water exists. 

**26)  Smartest People** 

*“He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.” (Ar-R’ad 13:2)*

All of these people knew about Islam and WERE NOT PERSUADED.

Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, Kurt Gödel, John von Neumann, Richard Feynman, Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, Noam Chomsky, Charles Darwin, Francis Crick, Blaise Pascal, Baruch Spinoza, Alan Turing, Terence Tao, Saul Kripke, Willard Van Orman Quine, Karl Popper, Ed Witten, Carl Sagan, Marvin Minsky, Alexander Grothendieck, James Clerk Maxwell, Leonhard Euler, Derek Parfit, John Stuart Mill, E.O. Wilson, William James, Douglas Hofstadter, Emile Durkheim, Nikola Tesla, Erwin Schrödinger, Hilary Putnam, Alfred Tarski, Carl Jung, Viktor Frankl, Ramanujan, Al-Razi, Al-Maʿarri, Ibn al-Rawandi.

These were among the most curious, reflective minds in history — and not one of them was persuaded by Islam.The elites converge on round Earth, old Earth, evolution, and heliocentrism. Why don’t they converge on this? The smartest aren’t convinced by Islam and yet the Quran says Allah gives clear signs.

**27)  Elephant Army** 

Surah Al-Fil 105 (*The Elephant*) says:

1. Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?
2. Did He not make their plan go astray?
3. And He sent against them flocks of birds,
4. Striking them with stones of baked clay,
5. And He made them like chewed-up straw.

An entire elephant army gets wrecked by birds dropping pebbles? You expect me to believe armored men and literal war elephants got shredded by flying birds dropping clay pellets? Which, by the way, have a low terminal velocity. Dropping a penny off of the Empire State Building won’t kill people, that’s a myth.

Why would God only make birds do stuff like this before cameras and videos were invented?

**28)  Free Will?** 

*  “*You will not will unless Allah wills.”* (Surah At-Takwir 81:29) → This verse strongly suggests a form of divine determinism: human will itself is contingent on God's will. You literally cannot choose unless God chooses that you choose.
*  “*Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves*.” (Surah Ar-Ra’d 13:11)  → This verse implies the opposite: that people must take the initiative to change, and then Allah will respond. That presupposes that people can change by their own will.

These two verses seem fundamentally incompatible. Either humans have autonomous willpower that can bring about change, or their will is wholly subject to God’s will.

And if the Quran’s stance on free will is clear, why have Muslims theologians and philosophers debated this for centuries?

**29)  Why Does It Look So Parochial?**

Heaven in Quran is not like optional bodies, mind melding, a large variety of totally new emotions, memory transfers, parallel universe creation, multiple time dimensions, extra spatial dimensions. No, it's gardens with attractive ladies. Why does it look like the imagination of a 7th century human?

It’s also striking that God’s morality isn’t the savage brutality of cavemen, nor the enlightened values of modern people, nor the unimaginable ethics of some far-future or alien society. Out of the full spectrum of possibilities, it ends up looking only slightly more refined than the norms of 7th-century Arabia. If divine morality could have been anything, the fact that it mirrors the moral intuitions (e.g. slavery) of Muhammad’s own time and place is awfully suspicious. It’s way better explained by people writing down their norms.

Or to put it another way, if God could have revealed any morality out of a trillion possibilities, why does scripture’s morality land so close to the cultural norms of its time? That’s what you’d expect from human authors. Imagine drawing numbers from a hat: if your friends could only write down 1–10, and God could write down 1–1,000,000,000,000, and the number drawn from the hat is “4,” it’s overwhelmingly more likely you chose your friend’s number not God’s.

**30)  Problem of Animal Suffering**  
There’s so much pain happening to innocent animals in the world. Why is a merciful God permitting this? There have been like septillions of animals that have ever lived and most of them had a painful death. 

The classic problem of evil is a problem for theists, and if theism is false, literalist Islam is false.

**31)  Problem of Divine Hiddenness**    
God either wants us to know him or not. *If not, he wouldn’t give us the Quran*. If yes, he would have made it more obvious. (He could write stuff in the stars.) If he doesn’t want it obvious, why do miracles?

The classic problem of divine hiddenness is a problem for theists and if theism is false, literalist Islam is false.

Remember, the Quran says, “He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.” (Ar-R’ad 13:2) 

Then he hides himself.

**32)  Narcissism**   
Why the heck would God want and demand praise? Do you care if ants praise you?

**33)  Why Did God Cause Mass Extinctions?** 

Why would God cause the Permian and Cretaceous mass extinctions? Killing a whole planet worth of life twice? Isn’t this kind of a wasteful method for an all powerful God to make humans? 

**34)  Alcohol And Slavery**

Why does the Quran clearly and explicitly ban usury and alcohol but is unclear on child marriage and slavery?

Millions of Muslims have thought slavery was okay, but they didn’t think alcohol was okay. Why would God not make it way, way clearer? If you are going to make alcohol clear, why not make slavery clear? 

Isn’t slavery way more important?

**35)  Biblical Confusions**  
The Quran confuses Moses & Aaron’s sister Miriam with Jesus’ mother Mary. Surah Maryam 19:28 calls Jesus’ mother “*sister of Aaron*,” and Surah At-Taḥrīm 66:12 labels her “*daughter of ʿImrān*.”Yet Aaron and his father Amram (ʿImrān) lived around 1,300 years before Mary. Early Jews in Medina reportedly mocked this genealogical mix-up. If Muslims argue that these titles are merely honorifics, it’s striking that, out of the entire range of possible honorific comparisons for Mary, the ones used just happen to resemble a Mary/Miriam confusion.

The Quran blames a “Samaritan” (*al-Samiri*) for the golden calf incident (20:85–95), but Samaritans didn’t exist until centuries after when Moses purportedly lived. That’s a major historical anachronism. It’s most likely an error from someone mishearing Jewish traditions.

The Qurans claim Jews think Ezra is the son of God which is false. (Surah At-Tawbah 9:30)

Also Quranic versions of Bible stories tend to be shorter and simpler. This is exactly what you'd expect if someone was half-remembering them. It's not what you'd expect if God (who knows the millimeter length of the eyelashes of everyone on Earth) was actually telling you the truth.

**36) Jesus vs. Muhammad:**

It’s strange to think that the peaceful ascetic who died telling people to love is not the main character of the religion, but the main character of the religion is the guy who sought young women and secular power. 

It’s also strange that in the Quran, Jesus is born of a virgin and raised alive to heaven, while Muhammad has an ordinary birth and dies an ordinary death. Strange that the “greater” prophet, the centerpiece of the religion, has the less miraculous entrance and exit.

**37)  Pairs** 

Surah Adh-Dhariyat 51:49 says,“And of everything We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction”

False, not everything exists in pairs. There’s only one universe, one Earth, one Muhammad. There are hermaphroditic (Leeches) and asexual reproducing species (Bdelloid rotifers). If the Quran meant “most things,” it could have used the Arabic word mu‘ẓam (معظم)—but it didn’t.

Surah Ar-Ra'd 13:3 says Allah “created fruits of every kind in pairs.” But most fruiting plants are hermaphrodites, not male and female. 

**38)  Uncle Abu Lahab**  
Surah Al-Masad (111) is a whole surah dedicated to shit talking Muhammad’s uncle, Abu Lahab. You think this is divine? 

*May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he!*

*His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained!*

*He will enter to burn in a Fire of flame!*

*And his wife as well - the carrier of firewood!*

*Around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber!*

It doesn’t even tell you what Abu Lahab did! So it can’t be for moral instruction. It’s arguably blasphemy to think God would write something that sounds like Hulk Hogan talking smack in a WWE promo.

Do you actually think God would spend an entire chapter of his final testament to mankind talking shit to one man and not explain what he did?

**39**) **False prophecies**

Muhammad told a young boy the world would end when he’s somewhat old. (Sahih Muslim 2953b)

Also, Muhammad said, ""*This matter (caliphate) will remain with the Quraysh even if only two of them were still existing.”* Sahih al-Bukhari 7140

**40) ​​ Selective-Charity Double Standard** 

The interpretive flexibilities, metaphorical re-definitions, and chain-skepticism that literalist Muslims might deploy to rescue Quranic difficulties are precisely the maneuvers they would dismiss if Christians defended the Gospels, Hindus justified the Vedas, or Mormons excused the Book of Mormon. If the same elastic toolkit were granted to every scripture, any text could be declared flawless.

**41) Actually Imagine a Perfect Book**  
Imagine a book that you could read both forwards and backwards. As in, the letters in all the words just so happen to be arranged such that the book could be meaningfully read both ways with different messages. That alone would be insane. But then also the chapter titles formed an acrostic and the whole book rhymed.

Oh and imagine this book contains so much scientific and mathematical knowledge that it would make scientists and mathematicians irrelevant for millenia.

Oh and imagine this book is so beautifully written that human beings 99% of the time cry and convert upon reading it.

Imagine a book that not only gives fantastic advice on current issues, with all their nuances and sub-nuances, but gives detailed advice about situations that will not occur for thousands of years.

Oh and it gives detailed advice about how to interpret it, so there are literally no feuds about the correct way to interpret it.

An infinitely intelligent God could definitely write such a book.

So why would he give us... the Quran?

**P.S)  Many of these Objections are Independent of Each Other**  
Addressing one argument does not resolve the others. Each independent criticism stands alone and reduces the probability and plausibility of literalist interpretations of Islam. Since the claim is that the Quran is perfect, demonstrating even a *single* flaw is sufficient to falsify the assertion.

We have two competing hypotheses:

*1) God gave Muhammad the Quran* 

*2) Muhammad made it up*

Given the amount of independent flaws we have found, “Muhammad made it up” is overwhelmingly the preferred hypothesis. 

**In summary**:  

*Sometimes showing a claim to be false is like killing an ant with a bazooka.*

We've found logical contradictions, scientific errors, aesthetic failures, self-serving motives, mathematical mistakes, factual blunders, moral atrocities, and signs of both ineptitude and pettiness. We've seen useless content, plagiarism, historical anachronisms, failed tests, probabilistic implausibility, character flaws, philosophical issues, false prophecies, unreliable transmission, childishness, boringness, incoherent structure, cultural narrowness, and ambiguity. At this point, it's hard to imagine in principle what kind of flaw a text could have that this one doesn't. And you’re telling me this is the perfect word of God?",68,https://www.reddit.com/r/CritiqueIslam/comments/1oh9oc2/why_islam_is_obviously_false/,"Why Islam is OBVIOUSLY False All of these alone are strong reasons not to be a literalist Muslim, but jointly they are devastating. And remember: one error is enough to falsify the hypothesis. Preliminary: There are thousands of religions worldwide so you have to start with an extremely low probability of Islam being specifically the right one before you even start the analysis. Also, the Quran makes thousands of distinct claims. Conjunctions of thousands of claims are less likely than single claims. So again this makes Islam extremely low probability before you even start the analysis. Now let’s get into it. 1 The Inheritance Problem There’s a mathematical error in the Quran. It directly instructs you to do a mathematical thing that’s impossible. Surah An-Nisa 4:11-12 If you die and have two daughters, two parents, and a wife, you literally cannot divide up the estate the way the Quran commands. It’s not plausible that God would make a simple math mistake. The fact that the Shia and Sunni disagree on how to interpret the inheritance verses proves that it’s not obvious from the text how you should handle this error. 2 Scientific Errors Stars/meteors are lamps used to pelt devils — Surah Al-Mulk 67:5 Babies come from an an \ejected\ fluid between the backbone and ribs — Surah At-Tariq 86:6–7 The Earth can talk — Surah Fussilat 41:11 / Az-Zalzalah 99:4 Ants can talk and have human concepts — Surah An-Naml 27:18–19 Mountains are like pegs to stabilize the Earth that’s flattened like a bed — Surah An-Naba 78:6–7 and Surah An-Nahl 16:15 Bones form first, then get clothed in muscle rather than forming in parallel — Surah al-Muʾminūn 23:12–14 A flock of birds destroyed an army of elephants by dropping clay stones on them — Surah al-Fil, 105:1–5. more on this later The Sun sets in a muddy spring — Surah Al-Kahf 18:86 The Quranic flood story Surah Hud 11:40–44 involves rain covering the world. But mixing freshwater rain with saltwater oceans would disrupt salinity levels and kill most marine life. Noah would’ve needed aquariums to save the fish. Also, how are you gonna fit over a million species on a boat and how do you explain why basically all the marsupials ended up in Australia? The Quran claims Lot’s peers are the first gay men. — Surah Al-A'raf 7:80 The Quran presents Adam and his wife as the literal first humans, created directly from clay, with all people descending from them e.g., Surah 4:1, 7:11, 38:71–72 In Surah 6:143–144, the Quran lists only four kinds of livestock—sheep, goats, camels, and cattle—and calls them “eight pairs.” This implies these are the only types God created for human use. But other domesticated species like llamas, alpacas, and reindeer existed long before Islam. The Quran describes God having a literal physical throne. Surah Ghafir 40:7 The Quran describes there being seven heavens or skies. Surah al-Mulk 67:3 The Earth is described in ways that suggest flatness: Surah An-Naba 78:6 These are clearly the views of an uneducated pre-scientific person. 3 Many Reliable Hadiths are Comical Many literalist Muslims treat the Sahih hadiths—especially those in Bukhari and Muslim—as effectively infallible or nearly so, believing them to be highly reliable and authoritative sources of religious guidance, second only to the Quran Dates the fruit make you not affected from magic or poison — Sahih al-Bukhari 5445 If a fly lands in your drink, dip it fully because one wing has poison and the other the cure — Sahih al-Bukhari 3320 Whoever orgasms first determines the baby’s sex — Sahih Muslim 315a / Sahih al-Bukhari 3329 Adam was \~90 feet tall and humanity has been shrinking since — Sahih al-Bukhari 3326 Trees can talk and are racist — Sahih Muslim 2922a Drinking camel urine is good medicine — Sahih al-Bukhari 5686 Some rats are transformed Jews and you can tell because they follow kosher diets – Sahih al-Bukhari 3305 Angels avoid houses with dogs — Sahih al-Bukhari 3322 Satan sleeps in your nose and ties your hair into knots when you are sleeping — Sahih al-Bukhari 1142 / Sahih al-Bukhari 3295 Most people in Hell are women and their intelligence is deficient – Sahih al-Bukhari 304 Which is funny because most rape and murder is commited by men. Monkeys stone other monkeys for adultery. - Sahih al-Bukhari 3849 Satan farts when the call to prayer happens because he is running away so quickly. - Sahih al-Bukhari 608 Drink sitting down, if you drink while standing then puke it up. — Sahih Muslim 2026 Both of God’s hands are right hands — Sunan an-Nasa'i 5379 You should wipe your butt with odd numbers of stones. — Sahih Muslim 239 It’s good to kill dogs, especially black dogs which are devils. — Sahih Muslim 1572 / Sahih Muslim 510a If a wife turns down sex, angels will curse her until morning — Sahih al-Bukhari 5193 Angels hate onions — Sahih muslim 564a Angels cause thunder — Jami\` at-Tirmidhi 3117 You should kill lizards — Sahih al-Bukhari 3359 / Sahih Muslim 2238 He blames all lizards for the crimes of some lizards which is racist. There are seven Earths that you can fall into. — Sahih al-Bukhari 2454 If Jews did not exist, meat would not decay — Sahih al-Bukhari 3399 A literal rock/stone can steal clothing and run away —Sahih al-Bukhari 3404 Do not eat with your left hand, because Satan eats with his left hand. — Sahih Muslim 2019 If Satan doing stuff means you shouldn’t do it, it implies that you shouldn’t talk, sleep, run, laugh etc. Don’t lie on your back with feet on top of each other. — Sahih Muslim 2099e Black seed Nigella sativa cures every disease except death — Sahih al-Bukhari 7:591 Don’t wipe your butt with camel poop. — Sahih Muslim 263 Why does this need to be said? The Sun prostrates under God's throne after it sets. — Sahih al-Bukhari 4802 Trees grab people. — Al Hakim al Mustadrak 3038 Tailbones don’t decay. — Sahih Muslim 2955a Backgammon is evil. — Sunan Ibn Majah 3763 Talking wolves exist and are into Islam. - Musnad Ahmad 11792. Pus is better than poetry. — Sahih al-Bukhari 6154 Muslims are at war with all snakes some of which are jinns. — Sunan Abu Dawud 5250, Al-Tabarani, Al-Mujam al-Kabir 11946 If you think these are metaphors, what is drinking camel piss a good metaphor for? 4 There are Literal Contradictions Which was made first, the Earth or the Heavens? Option 1 – Earth first: Earth created, then mountains, then heavens — Surah Fussilat 41:9–12 / 2:29 Option 2 – Heavens first: Heavens built, then Earth spread — Surah An-Nazi’at 79:27–30 Is Hell forever? Option 1 – Proportional punishment: “Whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except with the like thereof...” — Surah Ghafir 40:40 Option 2 – Eternal punishment: ""Abiding eternally therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved."" — Surah Al-Baqarah 2:39, 2:81, 2:217; Al-Imran 3:88; Al-Jinn 72:23 Do all good people of the book go to Heaven? Option 1 – Yes: “Those who believe in the Quran, and those who follow the Jewish scriptures, and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.” — Surah Al-Baqarah 2:62 Option 2 – No: “Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted by him and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers” — Surah Al-Imran 3:85 How Long is God’s Day? Option 1 – A day with Allah equals 1,000 years: “And indeed, a day with your Lord is like a thousand years of what you count.” — Surah Al-Hajj 22:47 Option 2 – A day with Allah equals 50,000 years: “The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in a day whose measure is fifty thousand years.” — Surah Al-Ma’arij 70:4 How Long Did Creation Take? Option 1 – Six Days: “Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days…” — Surah Al-A'raf 7:54, Surah Yunus 10:3, Surah Hud 11:7, Surah Al-Furqan 25:59 Option 2 – Eight Days Total when adding the steps: “He who created the earth in two days… then placed on it firmly set mountains above it and blessed it and determined therein its \creatures'\ sustenance in four days… Then He directed Himself to the heaven… and He completed them as seven heavens in two days…” — Surah Fussilat 41:9–12 → 2 days earth + 4 days mountains & sustenance + 2 days heavens = 8 days total It’s also weird that heavens which are quadrillions of times bigger than earth took way less time. Individual vs. Collective Justice Option 1 – Individual accountability only: ""No soul shall bear the burden of another"" — Surah 6:164, 35:18, 39:7, 53:38 Option 2 – Collective destruction: The People of Thamud destroyed by earthquake — Surah 7:73-79 → Did every infant in Thamud reject the prophet? You might say, “You’re just misinterpreting the verses. Scholars have answers for all of this.” Yes, and Hindu, Mormon, and Christian scholars all have answers for their texts too. The question isn’t whether apologetics exist—it’s whether they’re persuasive and plausible. 5 A Perfect Book Wouldn’t be this Ambiguous “These are the verses of the clear Book.” Surah Ash-Shu‘ara 26:2 Sometimes the Quran says “God is light” Surah An-Nur 24:35, sometimes that “the Earth talked” Surah Fussilat 41:11. Sometimes it says there are “locks on people’s hearts.” Surah Muhammad 47:24 There’s no clear note about whether these are metaphorical or literal. It would have been trivial to clear up such ambiguities. How can a literally perfect book not be clear? If there is a miscommunication between two people, the fault is on both people unless the speaker is maximally clear or the listener was maximally perceptive. It would have been trivial to make the Quran clearer so it isn’t maximally clear. So it’s not perfect. There should be no ambiguity on whether beating your wife or aggressive holy war are allowed. Obviously. Scholars have spent centuries debating what many verses mean without reaching consensus. If even the scholarly and faithful can’t agree after centuries of debate, it could have been written more clearly. And if it could have been written more clearly, it’s not perfect. Also, major Islamic schools e.g., Hanafi vs. Hanbali do not agree how to handle unmentioned things. Which is a pretty big deal! Something that could have easily been cleared up by a single line. The Quran also admits that some verses are unclear: Quran 3:7 “some verses are precise… while others are ambiguous.” Why not make all verses clear? The Quran 16:89 also says, “We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance.“ Which leads to a contradiction. .6 Obviously You obviously shouldn't believe a guy who tells you that God said he's allowed to have more wives than you. 7 Petty Vindictiveness Roughly 10 percent of verses in the Quran insult or threaten non-believers. I am not making that up. 10 percent. They’re called fools, blind, arrogant, or are told they’ll burn in hell. Oh, you think a perfectly wise and intelligent being is going to spend 10 percent of his holy text, his last testament to man, talking shit to the haters? Why not persuade the unbelievers rather than threaten and insult them? 8 Abrogation According to most Muslim scholars, later verses cancel earlier ones. Why would God not plan out his verses better so that you didn't need a principle of abrogation? 1. Surah Qaf 50:29 says, “My Word cannot be changed.” Which contradicts the principle of abrogation. 2. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:106 says, “If We ever abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We replace it with a better or similar one.” How can both of these both be true? Also, if abrogations exist, why was the Quran dynamically changing in the 20ish years of Muhammad’s preaching, but no dynamic changes were needed in the roughly 1400 years since Muhammad’s life? 9 Missing Guidance The Quran has three different verses on alcohol. But it has nothing on artificial intelligence, cloning, nuclear war, social media, germs/washing hands before surgery, environmental damage/climate change, vaccines, teleportation, transhumanism, aliens, mind uploading, robots, bioweapons, or exploring other planets. Why is liquor more important than those? Why would God not want to give us ethical and prudential advice on issues more complicated and consequential than liquor? Why give three verses on alcohol, but none on these? 10 Why Not Trivially Prove Itself From God God could have proven divine authorship easily. God could have listed the next 10,000 visible-from-Earth supernovas with their exact dates and coordinates. Why didn't God do something that would make it obvious that the Quran is not made by a human? The Quran contains no information a human at that time couldn't have known or guessed which is super suspicious. Like even just including an accurate description of Australia, Antarctica, North America, and South America would be eyebrow raising. Or mentioning dinosaurs or kangaroos. The Quran says, “He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.” Ar-R’ad 13:2 Yet he didn’t make it certain when he trivially could have. 11 Occam’s Razor Occam’s razor is brutal to religious texts. To believe the Quran is divine, you have to jointly accept thousands of distinct claims. Any of which could be wrong. It's a really complicated hypothesis. Just think about probability: A and B and C and D all happening is going to be less likely than just A happening. Suppose each verse has a .999 percent chance of being true: Multiplying .999 times itself 6236 times 0.00194 Multiplying .9999 times itself 6236 times is 0.5357 Analogously, even if each item in the phone book has an extremely high probability of being correct when you have thousands of items in the phonebook it becomes likely that there’s a mistake somewhere. Now, suppose you doubt this above iterated multiplication procedure, you should still accept that the more complicated the hypothesis, the lower the prior probability. For example, it’s obvious that “God exists” is, a priori, more likely than “God exists and is named Bob and likes playing bananagrams on Thursdays and likes the smell of goose eggs and likes vacationing in Cuba.” And ignoring all these subtle points about parsimony and probability, what’s more likely without any other info? A guy made up a story, or God wrote this specific book with these thousands of claims and there are no errors in it? 12 Splitting the Moon The Quran says Muhammad split the moon, but no one outside Arabia noticed this? No one in China or Byzantium wrote this down? 13 Fitna There were two civil wars immediately after Muhammad’s death. Ridda Wars/Fitna If Muhammad truly gave divine guidance, why did it immediately lead to bloodshed? I'd sort of expect peace and love to be the result of divine revelation. I also wouldn’t expect the Islamic slave trade and the conquest of Byzantium and the Sassanids. Nor would I expect the general poverty in Islamic countries today. 14 Dhul-Qarnayn This character in the Quran Dhul-Qarnayn matches Alexander the Great myths that were floating around Arabia at the time e.g., the Syriac Alexander Legend. If the Dhul-Qarnayn story were the real history of Alexander, you’d expect it to match earlier, more accurate Alexander writings. But it in fact aligns with later fantastical Alexander stories. When have legends gotten more accurate over time? Also, the Quranic passages containing Dhul-Qarnayn also claim Gog and Magog and their people are blocked behind a wall between two mountains until the end of time. Where are they? Why haven’t we found them? You think humans would have found a giant gate between mountains enclosing an army. 15 Don’t Show Up Early For Dinner Do you really think a perfect, infinitely intelligent timeless God would take up valuable space in his final holy book to say, ""Hey, don’t show up early to the Prophet’s house for dinner""? Surah Al-Ahzab 33:53 Isn't believing this kind of stupid? Don’t you think that within the limited space of the Quran, there was a more important point to make than that? 16 Hell There is a strong tension between these two verses: “We will cast them into the Fire. Whenever their skin is burnt completely, We will replace it so they will ˹constantly˺ taste the punishment.” Surah An-Nisa 4:56 and “Do not lose hope in Allah’s mercy, for Allah certainly forgives all sins. He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” Surah Az-Zumar 39:53 Why would the most merciful being torture someone like this for an eternity? Like you are saying after a quadrillion years of torture they haven’t had enough? They need another quadrillion years? And this is merciful? People who say this are just not imagining what a quadrillion years of torture actually is. It’s just childish to call someone who tortures someone for quadrillions of years a merciful being. 17 The Quran Gives a Falsifiability Test—and Fails It “And if you are in doubt… produce a surah like it…” Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23 Shortest surah is: “We have granted you al-Kawthar. So pray and sacrifice. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off.” This is not some unbeatable literary miracle. It’s not hard to write something more profound. Compare it to this fake Surah I invented. Surah al-Falaḥ The Flourishing Verily, do not kill, for life is sacred in the sight of the Most High. Do not steal, for the provision of your Lord is sufficient for those who walk upright. Do not rape, for the body is a trust, and to violate it is a crime before the heavens. Do not torture, for your Lord is the Most Merciful, and loves not the oppressors. Do not enslave for freedom is beloved in the mind of Most Righteous. Do not lie, for falsehood is the path of ruin, and truth is the light upon the straight path. And love your fellow man, and strive to bring flourishing to the earth, For your Lord made you stewards, not tyrants, and blessed are those who sow peace and righteousness. But at the end of the day, evaluating which text is ‘better’ is a subjective, non-truth-apt exercise. If the Quran stakes its truth on that kind of subjective test, the test is ill-posed—and that, by itself, undercuts the claim of divine intelligence. 18 The Satanic Verses Incident Early Islamic sources al-Tabari, Ibn Ishaq record Muhammad delivering verses praising pagan gods Allāt, Al-Uzza, and Manāt — then retracting the verses claiming they were Satanic deception. If Satan could trick Muhammad once, why assume he didn’t succeed more often? It proves that Muhammad is fallible, and can be tricked about what is from God and what is not from God. I know some modern Muslims want to deny this event happened, but earlier Muslims thought it happened, and why would you know better than them? 19 Hadiths are an Unreliable Method In Islam, many Muslims say the hadiths are necessary for interpreting the Quran. Why is God using an unreliable method—a game of Chinese whispers—to give you mandatory information for how to practice the faith? If it’s mandatory for the faith, why not just put it into the Quran itself? If God wanted to guide people clearly and unambiguously, why not stick to a single, safeguarded text? Why allow a bunch of opaque oral reports to become central to the religion, despite obvious risks of error and confusion. If hadith scholars who graded the reliability of hadiths are fallible, the whole system based on this is fallible. 20 Inside View vs Outside View From the inside view, your religion might feel incredibly compelling—emotionally resonant, logically sound, or simply self-evident. This personal perspective provides powerful subjective evidence. But from the outside view, however, billions throughout history have felt equally certain about other rival contradictory beliefs. Religious adherents cannot all be correct despite similar confidence levels. Just as a startup founder must balance internal optimism with the reality that 70% of startups fail, religious believers should weigh their personal confidence against the broader pattern of billions of religious people being wrong despite their similar certainty through history. Humans are very capable of incorrectly, confidently thinking they have sacred text from God. And you know humans are like this. You could be the kind of person that mistakenly thinks your holy text is right given that you know people do this all the time. 21 Morally Problematic Teachings The Quran permits wife-beating as a final step to discipline disobedient wives. Surah An-Nisa 4:34 The Quran permits sex with female slaves—without their consent or marriage. Surah Al-Mu’minun 23:5–6; An-Nisa 4:24; Al-Ahzab 33:50 The Quran prescribes cutting off the hands of thieves. Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:38 The Quran recommends crucifixion and cutting off hands and feet on opposite sides for rebels. Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:33 The Quran commands Muslims to kill polytheists wherever they find them. Surah At-Tawbah 9:5 Why not include a sunset clause if this is temporary. The Quran says a woman’s testimony is worth half a man’s in financial matters. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:282 The Quran allows marriage and divorce of girls who haven’t yet menstruated. Surah At-Talaq 65:4 The Quran endorses a story where a boy is killed—not for anything he did, but because he would have sinned in the future. Surah Al-Kahf 18:80 Even the “nice” lines can collapse into cruelty The Quran’s famous kind slogan — “Whoever kills a soul, it is as if he killed all mankind” 5:32 — is immediately followed by 5:33 prescribing crucifixion and maiming. The book seemingly can’t even let its most quoted “peaceful” verse breathe without pivoting straight back to brutality. Sort of surprising God would endorse or recommend things so vicious. Also, obviously any sacred text that doesn't explicitly ban slavery is not plausibly from God. 22 Muhammad’s Character isn’t Plausibly Divinely Guided He had sex with a 9-year-old Aisha, owned a sex slave Maria the Copt, married a woman right after killing her husband Safiyya bint Huyayy, initiated aggressive military actions Khaybar, owned slaves Sahih Muslim 115, and traded two black slaves for one Arab slave Sahih Muslim 1602a. He stopped visiting his second wife because she was too old and visited Aisha instead Saudah bint Zamʿah. He tongue kissed a young boy Hakim 4791 and Mufrad 1183. Muhammad said to a girl she shouldn't have freed her slavegirl and that she should have given the slavegirl to her uncle. Sahih al-Bukhari 2592 He married his step-daughter and arguably ended the practice of adoption merely so he could do that. Zaynab He declared the person who stabbed to death a woman, who disparaged him, shouldn't be punished. Sunan Abi Dawud 4361 Muhammad attacked the Quraysh caravan at Nakhlah during the sacred month of Rajab, which shattered the pan-Arab taboo against warfare in a holy month. Muhammad endorsed the execution of all pubescent males of the Banu Qurayza tribe and the enslavement of the women and children. Finally, Muhammad didn’t set up a stable succession system which led to awful turmoil. 23 The Scribe who Caught Muhammad Copying Him “If Muhammad is truthful then I receive the revelation as much as he does.” - ʿAbdullah ibn Saʿd One of Muhammad’s scribes, ʿAbdullah ibn Saʿd, left Islam after realizing Muhammad repeated his phrasings of verses as revelation Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah; al-Tabari, Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk. In at least one case, after the scribe added a flourish like “So blessed be Allah, the best of creators!”, Muhammad reportedly agreed and said it should be part of the verse. ʿAbdullah ibn Saʿd thought: “Wait, this isn’t divine, I said that—he’s just going with whatever sounds good.” He also messed around with word orderings to see if Muhammad would notice. He left, told people, and Muhammad ordered him killed and he was only pardoned because he was family with one of Muhammad's close companions, Uthman. 24 The Injustice of Geography Why did Arabs get this blessing of divine knowledge? Why didn’t God send a Muhammad type prophet to the Cambodians, Nigerians, Dutch, and Apache? Why did they have to wait hundreds of years to receive God’s blessing of the Quran? Isn’t that unfair? This fact of the Quran showing up once in Arabia makes total sense if Muhammad made up the book. It makes less sense if God wanted to give all of humanity his divine instruction. Also, most people stay in the religion they’re raised in. Yet under traditional Islam, salvation depends on accepting Islam—meaning a Hindu child in India is, by many interpretations, far more likely to go to hell than a Muslim born in Arabia, simply due to birthplace. If eternal torment depends on such chance, Islam starts to look less like justice and more like a cosmic lottery with infinite pain as a consequence rigged by geography. 25 Miscellaneous Errors 2:6 – “Indeed, those who disbelieve — it is all the same whether you warn them or do not warn them — they will not believe.” → False. Some disbelievers do respond to warnings. This is an overgeneralization. If it’s just saying “stubborn people are stubborn,” there’s no reason to bring it up. 2:120 – “The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion.” → False. Jews don’t try to convert people in general; it’s not a proselytizing faith. Historically, many Jews and Christians have admired Muhammad or respected Muslims without requiring conversion. 107:1–2 – “Have you seen the one who denies the final Judgment? That is the one who repulses the orphan.” → False. Not all who deny judgment repulse orphans. Many atheists and agnostics care for them and are loved. 21:104 – “On that Day We will roll up the sky like a scroll of writings.” → False. You cannot roll up the sky—it’s made of air and space, with nothing physical to roll. 2:2 – “This is the Book about which there is no doubt…” → False. People do doubt it; atheists and others openly reject it. 5:67 – “And Allah will protect you from the people.” → False. Muhammad was wounded in battle and poisoned, 4:82 – “If it were from any other than Allah, they would have found many discrepancies in it.” → False. Plenty of books not from God—short novels, instruction manuals, even some history books—are entirely free of discrepancies. 54:40 “And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember.” → False. Memorizing the Quran is not easy. 25:53 “And He is the One Who merges the two bodies of water: one fresh and palatable and the other salty and bitter, placing between them a barrier they cannot cross.” → False. Salt water and freshwater mix all the time. Brackish water exists. 26 Smartest People “He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.” Ar-R’ad 13:2 All of these people knew about Islam and WERE NOT PERSUADED. Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, Kurt Gödel, John von Neumann, Richard Feynman, Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, Noam Chomsky, Charles Darwin, Francis Crick, Blaise Pascal, Baruch Spinoza, Alan Turing, Terence Tao, Saul Kripke, Willard Van Orman Quine, Karl Popper, Ed Witten, Carl Sagan, Marvin Minsky, Alexander Grothendieck, James Clerk Maxwell, Leonhard Euler, Derek Parfit, John Stuart Mill, E.O. Wilson, William James, Douglas Hofstadter, Emile Durkheim, Nikola Tesla, Erwin Schrödinger, Hilary Putnam, Alfred Tarski, Carl Jung, Viktor Frankl, Ramanujan, Al-Razi, Al-Maʿarri, Ibn al-Rawandi. These were among the most curious, reflective minds in history — and not one of them was persuaded by Islam.The elites converge on round Earth, old Earth, evolution, and heliocentrism. Why don’t they converge on this? The smartest aren’t convinced by Islam and yet the Quran says Allah gives clear signs. 27 Elephant Army Surah Al-Fil 105 The Elephant says: 1. Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant? 2. Did He not make their plan go astray? 3. And He sent against them flocks of birds, 4. Striking them with stones of baked clay, 5. And He made them like chewed-up straw. An entire elephant army gets wrecked by birds dropping pebbles? You expect me to believe armored men and literal war elephants got shredded by flying birds dropping clay pellets? Which, by the way, have a low terminal velocity. Dropping a penny off of the Empire State Building won’t kill people, that’s a myth. Why would God only make birds do stuff like this before cameras and videos were invented? 28 Free Will? “You will not will unless Allah wills.” Surah At-Takwir 81:29 → This verse strongly suggests a form of divine determinism: human will itself is contingent on God's will. You literally cannot choose unless God chooses that you choose. “Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.” Surah Ar-Ra’d 13:11 → This verse implies the opposite: that people must take the initiative to change, and then Allah will respond. That presupposes that people can change by their own will. These two verses seem fundamentally incompatible. Either humans have autonomous willpower that can bring about change, or their will is wholly subject to God’s will. And if the Quran’s stance on free will is clear, why have Muslims theologians and philosophers debated this for centuries? 29 Why Does It Look So Parochial? Heaven in Quran is not like optional bodies, mind melding, a large variety of totally new emotions, memory transfers, parallel universe creation, multiple time dimensions, extra spatial dimensions. No, it's gardens with attractive ladies. Why does it look like the imagination of a 7th century human? It’s also striking that God’s morality isn’t the savage brutality of cavemen, nor the enlightened values of modern people, nor the unimaginable ethics of some far-future or alien society. Out of the full spectrum of possibilities, it ends up looking only slightly more refined than the norms of 7th-century Arabia. If divine morality could have been anything, the fact that it mirrors the moral intuitions e.g. slavery of Muhammad’s own time and place is awfully suspicious. It’s way better explained by people writing down their norms. Or to put it another way, if God could have revealed any morality out of a trillion possibilities, why does scripture’s morality land so close to the cultural norms of its time? That’s what you’d expect from human authors. Imagine drawing numbers from a hat: if your friends could only write down 1–10, and God could write down 1–1,000,000,000,000, and the number drawn from the hat is “4,” it’s overwhelmingly more likely you chose your friend’s number not God’s. 30 Problem of Animal Suffering There’s so much pain happening to innocent animals in the world. Why is a merciful God permitting this? There have been like septillions of animals that have ever lived and most of them had a painful death. The classic problem of evil is a problem for theists, and if theism is false, literalist Islam is false. 31 Problem of Divine Hiddenness God either wants us to know him or not. If not, he wouldn’t give us the Quran. If yes, he would have made it more obvious. He could write stuff in the stars. If he doesn’t want it obvious, why do miracles? The classic problem of divine hiddenness is a problem for theists and if theism is false, literalist Islam is false. Remember, the Quran says, “He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.” Ar-R’ad 13:2 Then he hides himself. 32 Narcissism Why the heck would God want and demand praise? Do you care if ants praise you? 33 Why Did God Cause Mass Extinctions? Why would God cause the Permian and Cretaceous mass extinctions? Killing a whole planet worth of life twice? Isn’t this kind of a wasteful method for an all powerful God to make humans? 34 Alcohol And Slavery Why does the Quran clearly and explicitly ban usury and alcohol but is unclear on child marriage and slavery? Millions of Muslims have thought slavery was okay, but they didn’t think alcohol was okay. Why would God not make it way, way clearer? If you are going to make alcohol clear, why not make slavery clear? Isn’t slavery way more important? 35 Biblical Confusions The Quran confuses Moses & Aaron’s sister Miriam with Jesus’ mother Mary. Surah Maryam 19:28 calls Jesus’ mother “sister of Aaron,” and Surah At-Taḥrīm 66:12 labels her “daughter of ʿImrān.”Yet Aaron and his father Amram ʿImrān lived around 1,300 years before Mary. Early Jews in Medina reportedly mocked this genealogical mix-up. If Muslims argue that these titles are merely honorifics, it’s striking that, out of the entire range of possible honorific comparisons for Mary, the ones used just happen to resemble a Mary/Miriam confusion. The Quran blames a “Samaritan” al-Samiri for the golden calf incident 20:85–95, but Samaritans didn’t exist until centuries after when Moses purportedly lived. That’s a major historical anachronism. It’s most likely an error from someone mishearing Jewish traditions. The Qurans claim Jews think Ezra is the son of God which is false. Surah At-Tawbah 9:30 Also Quranic versions of Bible stories tend to be shorter and simpler. This is exactly what you'd expect if someone was half-remembering them. It's not what you'd expect if God who knows the millimeter length of the eyelashes of everyone on Earth was actually telling you the truth. 36 Jesus vs. Muhammad: It’s strange to think that the peaceful ascetic who died telling people to love is not the main character of the religion, but the main character of the religion is the guy who sought young women and secular power. It’s also strange that in the Quran, Jesus is born of a virgin and raised alive to heaven, while Muhammad has an ordinary birth and dies an ordinary death. Strange that the “greater” prophet, the centerpiece of the religion, has the less miraculous entrance and exit. 37 Pairs Surah Adh-Dhariyat 51:49 says,“And of everything We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction” False, not everything exists in pairs. There’s only one universe, one Earth, one Muhammad. There are hermaphroditic Leeches and asexual reproducing species Bdelloid rotifers. If the Quran meant “most things,” it could have used the Arabic word mu‘ẓam معظم—but it didn’t. Surah Ar-Ra'd 13:3 says Allah “created fruits of every kind in pairs.” But most fruiting plants are hermaphrodites, not male and female. 38 Uncle Abu Lahab Surah Al-Masad 111 is a whole surah dedicated to shit talking Muhammad’s uncle, Abu Lahab. You think this is divine? May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he! His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained! He will enter to burn in a Fire of flame! And his wife as well - the carrier of firewood! Around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber! It doesn’t even tell you what Abu Lahab did! So it can’t be for moral instruction. It’s arguably blasphemy to think God would write something that sounds like Hulk Hogan talking smack in a WWE promo. Do you actually think God would spend an entire chapter of his final testament to mankind talking shit to one man and not explain what he did? 39 False prophecies Muhammad told a young boy the world would end when he’s somewhat old. Sahih Muslim 2953b Also, Muhammad said, ""This matter caliphate will remain with the Quraysh even if only two of them were still existing.” Sahih al-Bukhari 7140 40 ​​ Selective-Charity Double Standard The interpretive flexibilities, metaphorical re-definitions, and chain-skepticism that literalist Muslims might deploy to rescue Quranic difficulties are precisely the maneuvers they would dismiss if Christians defended the Gospels, Hindus justified the Vedas, or Mormons excused the Book of Mormon. If the same elastic toolkit were granted to every scripture, any text could be declared flawless. 41 Actually Imagine a Perfect Book Imagine a book that you could read both forwards and backwards. As in, the letters in all the words just so happen to be arranged such that the book could be meaningfully read both ways with different messages. That alone would be insane. But then also the chapter titles formed an acrostic and the whole book rhymed. Oh and imagine this book contains so much scientific and mathematical knowledge that it would make scientists and mathematicians irrelevant for millenia. Oh and imagine this book is so beautifully written that human beings 99% of the time cry and convert upon reading it. Imagine a book that not only gives fantastic advice on current issues, with all their nuances and sub-nuances, but gives detailed advice about situations that will not occur for thousands of years. Oh and it gives detailed advice about how to interpret it, so there are literally no feuds about the correct way to interpret it. An infinitely intelligent God could definitely write such a book. So why would he give us... the Quran? P.S Many of these Objections are Independent of Each Other Addressing one argument does not resolve the others. Each independent criticism stands alone and reduces the probability and plausibility of literalist interpretations of Islam. Since the claim is that the Quran is perfect, demonstrating even a single flaw is sufficient to falsify the assertion. We have two competing hypotheses: 1 God gave Muhammad the Quran 2 Muhammad made it up Given the amount of independent flaws we have found, “Muhammad made it up” is overwhelmingly the preferred hypothesis. In summary: Sometimes showing a claim to be false is like killing an ant with a bazooka. We've found logical contradictions, scientific errors, aesthetic failures, self-serving motives, mathematical mistakes, factual blunders, moral atrocities, and signs of both ineptitude and pettiness. We've seen useless content, plagiarism, historical anachronisms, failed tests, probabilistic implausibility, character flaws, philosophical issues, false prophecies, unreliable transmission, childishness, boringness, incoherent structure, cultural narrowness, and ambiguity. At this point, it's hard to imagine in principle what kind of flaw a text could have that this one doesn't. And you’re telling me this is the perfect word of God?"

comment,CritiqueIslam,"Point No.36 is extremely strange when you think more about it. From quranic perspective, Allah certainly has a preference for Isa and his mother


Allah chooses and purifies a woman above all the women of the worlds (Surah 3 42) and breathes his spirit into her private parts to conceive Isa (Surah 66 12). After Adam and Eve are created, everyone is born from procreation but for some very strange reason Allah decides Isa should be born of a virgin. Look at the way he makes her pregnant (How can he even deny hes the father?)


Isa can create life like the way Allah does  (By breathin into clay) and he can revive the dead (Surah 3 49). Isa is a Spirit from Allah (Surah 4 171). Isa also cant die. Hes taken upto Allah himself. Isa is chilling with Allah for 2000 years while Muhamamd is in the grave. Isa is also coming back to judge as a ruler. 


Since Isa has outlived Muhamamd by 1300 years (Muhammad died but Isa is alive) and Isa is also coming back, shouldnt he the Seal of the Prophets?. Btw Isa is also Messiah and the quran doesnt tell why and just leaves it at that.


Also Satan touches everyone at birth except Isa and Maryam (Sahih al-Bukhari 3431). Muhammad was bamboozled by Satan.  He was bewitched (Sahih al-Bukhari 3175) and dont forget about the Satanic verses. Just why is the difference so much? Just why?


Unrelated to the above point but Surah 33 53 by itself should be mentioned as a separate point. Allah could have avoided fitna by saying Muhammad's successor in the quran but nope. He wastes revelations chasing Muhamamd's  houseguests away and telling him to marry his adopted sons wife. Allah has weird priorities


""O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him.

&#x200B;

**What is Neuralink?**

[Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/) is a neurotechnology startup developing neural interfaces to enable high-bandwidth communication between humans and computers. The stated goal of Neuralink is to achieve symbiosis with artificial general intelligence. It was founded by Elon Musk, Vanessa Tolosa, Ben Rapoport, Dongjin Seo, Max Hodak, Paul Merolla, Philip Sabes, Tim Gardner, and Tim Hanson, and first publicly reported in 2017.

&#x200B;

**What is a neural interface?**

A neural interface is a device which enables communication between the human nervous system and computers. There is an enormous variety of neural interfaces, including everything from invasive brain implants to noninvasive sensors worn throughout the body. Different methods have different strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.

&#x200B;

**What is the state-of-the-art for invasive brain implants?**

Current implants have been able to:

* [Stop tremors to allow a violinist to play again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3QQOQAILZw)
* [Allow quadriplegics to control robotic arms with their minds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76lIQtE8oDY)
* Treat epilepsy, depression, and Parkinson's

&#x200B;

**What are the limitations of current brain implants?**

Current implants are lacking in terms of:

* How much of the brain they can communicate with
* How safe they are for the body
* How safe they are to insert into the body
* How long they can last
* How effectively they can both read information from and stimulate into the brain

&#x200B;

**What will Neuralink announce?**

No information regarding Neuralink's specific work has yet been made publicly available. Given comments by Elon Musk as well as job postings, it is possible that improved invasive brain implants, medical applications, animal research, and robotic surgery will be discussed.

It was a pretty long “few months”, but I’m sure it will be well worth it.

comment,Neuralink,"I've been curious about Neuralink ever since I heard of it. I'm a Registered Nurse and I'm finishing my graduate degree in operating room nursing. I really hope I get to work with brain implants in the future. I've always had a passion for learning new things, before becoming a nurse I worked as a programmer (without a formal education). My dream would be to get a second degree in medical or electrical engineering and work on developing implants and/or surgical equipment (at neuralink perhaps or my own company?). Though at nearly 30 years old, I'm getting a lot of criticism for having spent so many years studying already, and my CV isn't that impressive. So I'm a bit worried about investing 5 more years of my life not working. Do you think it would be worthwile to get a degree in engineering as well?",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Neuralink/comments/cdxxyr/megathread_official_neuralink_event_716_8pm_pt/,"I've been curious about Neuralink ever since I heard of it.
