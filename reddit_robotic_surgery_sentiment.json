        "body": "The following submission statement was provided by /u/mvea:\n\n---\n\nAutonomous robot surgeon removes organs with 100% success rate\n\nWe're a step closer to entering an operating theater without any human life besides ours, following the world's first surgery performed by a robot responding and learning in real time. Its precision and skill matched that of experienced surgeons.\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University trained a robot on videos of operations, and then had it conduct a gallbladder removal on its own \u2013 with no mechanical help, just voice commands, like a theater team assisting the lead surgeon. Named SRT-H (Surgical Robot Transformer-Hierarchy), the robot absorbed its training and converted it to practice, with the ability to extract the gallbladder time and time again, and adjusting in real-time when needed.\n\nWhile this study details SRT-H's complete gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) across eight different surgeries, it's worth noting these were performed on a realistic human-like model, but, understandably, not a human. However, the tissues used in the human-like models closely mimicked ours, and the robot breezed through the operation that required 17 tasks to be performed, each lasting minutes. It was able to identify specific ducts and arteries and grab them precisely, strategically place clips and sever parts with scissors.\n\nHere\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adt5254\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1lw8kty/autonomous_robot_surgeon_removes_organs_with_100/n2c37f2/",

        "body": "This is a very cool development, that I'm sure will continue to take great strides over the coming decades. That being said, this headline is misleading. It doesn't \"remove organs\", as in any organ. This particular project was on cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal). It uses real videos for learning, but it hasn't operated on a real person, but rather only uses models. Any surgeon will tell you that the models never quite fully replicate the real thing and the real challenges. No model I've seen actually feels/behaves like real human tissue, it doesn't bleed, there won't be scar tissue from prior surgeries or prior infection, etc. It's like having a race car driver compete against an AI on Mario kart and then claiming the AI performance matched experienced race car drivers. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm really excited about this! However, I think we're a really long way off from these robots operating independently on the full variability of human anatomy with equivalent outcomes to a human surgeon. I anticipate the first step will be more like driver assistance features (E.g. Warning! You are about to enter the left hepatic artery. Would you like to proceed?) \n\nSource: I'm a robotic surgeon.\nDisclaimer: I did not pay for the full scientific article so my assessment is based on the researcher's abstract.",

There's also many surgeries that must be done open (removal of large tumors, large organ transplants, traumas, placing trocars, closing skin, conversion to open when things go sideways, etc) so learners should always have at least some real life exposure. \n\nIt's interesting to think about what a surgeon's role may be in 100 years. Perhaps akin to a pilot where a human does some things and the robot does other things with the human on standby in case they need to step in? I guess we'll see, or at least our children and grandchildren will see!",

It's obvious that it still needs a lot of work, otherwise we'd have cosmetic surgery on every other street corner for an hours wages, and people would go in for preventative heart transplants as lab grown organ research would explode with demand offered by affordable surgery for all. Yes, there's a long way to go and I think some of the problems that you posit are a little short sighted while the others will indeed take some figuring out - I also wonder about anomalous anatomical circumstances where reason and adaptation are necessary, but those are things that will come in time. For me it's not a question of if but when, and this is just the beginning of a very, very different world that I think is coming in the very near future. For right now, though, I wonder if study, videos, training, coaching and a dummy, might benefit from all of that same stuff but by replacing the dummies with cadavers.",

Every physician I know doesn't even look at that because it's faulty and wrong half the time.  And that's just reading squiggly lines.  Imagine a machine having to make judgement calls to figure out if a patient needs just the aortic valve replaced vs. multiple valves (which I've seen a surgeon have to make that decision in the OR itself, not with the echo).",

Humans are more complex (currently) than any robots we can build, but I'm pretty confident that's not going to be the case for very long. I understand there's a trust factor with having another human perform the operation, but to think that a brain and a hand is better off than a highly specialized and super-intelligent robot is kinda crazy. \n\nWe're getting closer and closer to super-intelligence. Once we achieve it, humans and our small brains will be no match for what we will be able to create. I see the same reservations about self-driving cars, but when you begin to understand how fast neural networks can learn, you realize that we're nearly at a tipping point for full scale automation.  \n\nJust my opinion, though.

I'm not a general surgeon, but I'm going into a procedural field (interventional radiology to be precise) so I do have some perspective as far as that goes. \n\nThis article is a bit ridiculous and misleading. A surgeon could apprentice someone who has never been to medical school on how to do pretty much any type of procedure. That's not the hard part *per se.*\n\nWhat you **really** need to learn is the cognitive aspect of surgery. Why am I taking this patient to the OR? Are they a good surgical candidate? What happens when something doesn't go as planned? How is the tissue going to react to what I want to do? What happens when you open and find something you didn't expect? \n\nThe most challenging part of surgery isn't tying knots or making cuts. It's knowing when to take the right patient to the right surgery at the right time, and knowing how to solve problems as the come up so you can get out of trouble when you're operating. That takes knowledge and planning and executive function skills that cannot currently be replaced with a machine. ",

    "selftext": "I am a hospital-based physician, and despite all the hype, artificial intelligence remains an unpopular subject among my colleagues. Not because we see it as a competitor, but because\u2014at least in its current state\u2014it has proven largely useless in our field. I say \u201cat least for now\u201d because I do believe AI has a role to play in medicine, though more as an adjunct to clinical practice rather than as a replacement for the diagnostician. Unfortunately, many of the executives promoting these technologies exaggerate their value in order to drive sales.\n\nI feel compelled to write this because I am constantly bombarded with headlines proclaiming that AI will soon replace physicians. These stories are often written by well-meaning journalists with limited understanding of how medicine actually works, or by computer scientists and CEOs who have never cared for a patient.\n\nThe central flaw, in my opinion, is that AI lacks nuance. Clinical medicine is a tapestry of subtle signals and shifting contexts. A physician\u2019s diagnostic reasoning may pivot in an instant\u2014whether due to a dramatic lab abnormality or something as delicate as a patient\u2019s tone of voice. AI may be able to process large datasets and recognize patterns, but it simply cannot capture the endless constellation of human variables that guide real-world decision making.\n\nYes, you will find studies claiming AI can match or surpass physicians in diagnostic accuracy. But most of these experiments are conducted by computer scientists using oversimplified vignettes or outdated case material\u2014scenarios that bear little resemblance to the complexity of a live patient encounter.\n\nTake EKGs, for example. A lot of patients admitted to the hospital requires one. EKG machines already use computer algorithms to generate a preliminary interpretation, and these are notoriously inaccurate. That is why both the admitting physician and often a cardiologist must review the tracings themselves. Even a minor movement by the patient during the test can create artifacts that resemble a heart attack or dangerous arrhythmia. I have tested anonymized tracings with AI models like ChatGPT, and the results are no better: the interpretations were frequently wrong, and when challenged, the model would retreat with vague admissions of error.\n\nThe same is true for imaging. AI may be trained on billions of images with associated diagnoses, but place that same technology in front of a morbidly obese patient or someone with odd posture  and the output is suddenly unreliable. On chest xrays, poor tissue penetration can create images that mimic pneumonia or fluid overload, leading AI astray. Radiologists, of course, know to account for this.\n\nIn surgery, I\u2019ve seen  glowing references to \u201crobotic surgery.\u201d In reality, most surgical robots are nothing more than precision instruments controlled entirely by the surgeon who remains in the operating room, one of the benefits being that they do not have to scrub in. The robots are tools\u2014not autonomous operators.\n\nSomeday, AI may become a powerful diagnostic tool in medicine. But its greatest promise, at least for now, lies not in diagnosis or treatment but in administration: things lim scheduling and billing. As it stands today, its impact on the actual practice of medicine has been minimal.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you so much for all your responses. I\u2019d like to address all of them individually but time is not on my side \ud83e\udd23.  \n\n1) the headline was intentional rage bait to invite you to partake in the conversation. My messages that AI in clinical practice has not lived up to the expectations of the sales pitch. I acknowledge that it is not computer scientists, but rather executives and middle management, that are responsible for this.  They exaggerate the current merits of AI to increase sales. \n\n2) I\u2019m very happy that people that have a foot in each door - medicine and computer science - chimed in and gave very insightful feedback.  I am also thankful to the physicians who mentioned the pivotal role AI plays in minimizing our administrative burden, As I mentioned in my original post, this is where the technology has been most impactful.  It seems that most MDs responding appear confirm my sentiments with regards the minimal diagnostic value of AI.\n\n3) My reference to ChatGPT with respect to my own clinical practice was in relation to comparing its efficacy to our error prone EKG interpreting AI technology that we use in our  hospital.\n\n4) Physician medical errors seem to be a point of contention. I\u2019m so sorry to anyone to anyone whose family member has been affected by this. It\u2019s a daunting task to navigate the process of correcting medical errors, especially if you are not familiar with the diagnosis, procedures, or administrative nature of the medical decision making process.   I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that one of the studies that were referenced point to a medical error mortality rate of less than 1% -specifically the Johns Hopkins study (which is more of a literature review). Unfortunately, morbidity does not seem to be mentioned so I can\u2019t account for that but it\u2019s fair to say that a mortality rate of 0.71% of all admissions is a pretty reassuring figure.  Parse that with the error rates of AI and I think one would be more impressed with the human decision making process.\n\n5) Lastly, I\u2019m sorry the word tapestry was so provocative. Unfortunately it took away from the conversation but I\u2019m glad at the least people can have some fun at my expense \ud83d\ude02.\n",

OP points out many ways in which modern AI tools can't really help in medical settings. While I can see ways that the technology will improve, they are much more likely to work together with medical professionals rather than replacing them. If AI replaces workers, you swap out all the qualities and problems of workers for the problems and qualities of AI. If you use AI and workers, they can improve each other's qualities and mitigate each other flaws.",

I heavily have used AI as a therapist. It is the best I have because the system is so broken.\n\nLike AI can't replace physical test, bloodwork, and the like.

I was figuring a disc in his back slipped or something. Yesterday he went in for bloodwork and we found yes this was the problem and his numbers were way off. We aren't out of the woods, but there is a real chance without AI he would've been dead by now.

The fact that all specialties continue to punt all the \"difficult patients\" and many chronic conditions back to the provider with the least training (primary care) or gaslight patients as psych cases should tell you everything you need to know about how \"nuanced\" doctors are.\n\nI think patients with pain complications after surgery are the perfect example. Medicine acknowledges that 1) pain needs to be treated adequately early to help prevent chronic pain and that it often 2) requires a personalized, multimodal approach and that 3) chronic pain is the most common complication following surgery. Yet, they have surgical pain patients bounce around from the anesthesia provider, to the surgeon, then to their primary, and then maybe to physical therapist or a pain specialist if they're lucky. And no one wants to really treat them if they can't do an expensive procedure. So nuanced \ud83d\ude44",

No kidding, it takes years or decades for something to become common in clinical practice.\n\nWhen they mentioned uploading traces to GPT\u2026that really undercut their argument. They need to see a demo by an actual cutting edge product in the space, not uploading EKGs to a language model that was trained with RLHF based on preference, not ground truth.\n\nI could go on, but I'm probably preaching to the choir. Glad to hear of your company - radiology has so much promise, but I feel like it'll be held back by physicians who saw a demo once in 2017 (or in 2024 of a product made in 2017) and think tech hasn't advanced since then.",

    "selftext": "***New robot delivers ultra-precise syringes and is quickly ready for use*** \\- Even many surgeons now admit that medical robots can operate with greater precision than human surgeons. However, the complex preparation for robotic surgeries still takes far too long. The new robotic assistant for eye surgery for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), developed by the Technical University of Munich (TUM), on the other hand, is ready to operate in just under five minutes. Doctors currently treat AMD with medications injected into the side of the eye. The robot is capable of delivering injections with a deviation of just 15 micrometers into the 200 micrometer-thick retina. This delivers the drug precisely to the right spot, where it can block a growth factor that, if left unchecked, would lead to blindness. Currently, almost 200 million people worldwide suffer from the disease; by 2040, this number is expected to rise to more than 280 million. People over 60 are particularly affected, with AMD being the cause of almost one in ten cases of blindness among them.\n\n**Publications**\n\n**(1)** PAROS: Multi-Component Robotic System and an Image-Guided Patient Alignment for Robot-Assisted Ophthalmic Surgery; Alireza Alikhani, Van Dai Nguyen, Satoshi Inagaki, Benjamin Busam, Koorosh Faridpooya, Mathias Maier, Peter Gehlbach, Iulian Iordachita, Nassir Navab, M.

    "selftext": "[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adt5254](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adt5254)\n\n\"Research on autonomous surgery has largely focused on simple task automation in controlled environments. However, real-world surgical applications demand dexterous manipulation over extended durations and robust generalization to the inherent variability of human tissue. These challenges remain difficult to address using existing logic-based or conventional end-to-end learning strategies. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical framework for performing dexterous, long-horizon surgical steps. Our approach uses a high-level policy for task planning and a low-level policy for generating low-level trajectories. The high-level planner plans in language space, generating task-level or corrective instructions that guide the robot through the long-horizon steps and help recover from errors made by the low-level policy. We validated our framework through ex vivo experiments on cholecystectomy, a commonly practiced minimally invasive procedure, and conducted ablation studies to evaluate key components of the system. Our method achieves a 100% success rate across eight different ex vivo gallbladders, operating fully autonomously without human intervention. The hierarchical approach improved the policy\u2019s ability to recover from suboptimal states that are inevitable in the highly dynamic environment of realistic surgical applications. This work demonstrates step-level autonomy in a surgical procedure, marking a milestone toward clinical deployment of autonomous surgical systems.\"",

    "title": "From Assembly Lines to Surgery: Why China Trusts Robots \u2014 and QNX Makes It Possible",
    "selftext": "\nOn April 30 and May 6, 2025, BlackBerry's QNX division released a two-part global research report showing a significant rise in the adoption of robotics in workplaces, with China emerging as the clear leader in both implementation and trust. The data, based on a survey conducted between March 5 and March 14, 2025, among 1,000 senior decision-makers in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, and heavy industry, highlights not only a rapid global shift toward automation, but also the growing importance of trust, safety, and performance as key enablers.\n\nGlobally, 77% of technology leaders now say they trust robots to perform critical workplace functions. In China, that number rises to a striking 92%. Furthermore, 89% of Chinese companies have already adopted some form of robotics, significantly above the global average of 50%. Chinese executives also expect that 32% of jobs will be automated by robotics within the next decade\u2014compared to 20% globally.\n\nThe most common uses of robots include automation, manufacturing, logistics, support functions, and high-risk environments. What drives trust in these machines? The report identifies two primary factors: proven reliability and performance (cited by 43% of Chinese respondents), and strong safety and risk control mechanisms (40%). These elements are especially crucial when humans work alongside robots, where even small software failures can lead to serious consequences.\n\nComfort levels vary across industries and use cases. In China, most respondents feel positive about robot collaboration on structured tasks such as assembly lines (94%) and logistics (90%). However, this comfort drops in sensitive or complex fields\u2014such as robotic-assisted surgery\u2014where only 74% feel at ease, and 25% express clear discomfort. This mirrors global attitudes, where robots are welcomed for repetitive or dangerous work, but met with hesitation in areas requiring empathy, precision, or human judgment.\n\nDespite strong adoption, safety remains a concern. Globally, 58% of respondents are worried about the cybersecurity risks that robotics introduce, and 29% report actual safety incidents involving robots. In China, 31% of respondents share safety concerns, and 24% have experienced robot-related accidents first-hand. These figures show that while trust in technology is growing, it remains fragile and must be supported by robust safety systems, transparent governance, and resilient infrastructure.\n\nThis is where BlackBerry QNX plays a foundational role. While often invisible to end users, QNX\u2019s technology is essential to the safe and secure functioning of robotic systems. The company provides real-time operating systems (RTOS), hypervisors, middleware, and development tools designed specifically for high-stakes environments like robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and industrial automation.\n\nQNX software is known for its reliability\u2014used in over 255 million vehicles globally\u2014and is trusted by nine of the world\u2019s ten largest medical device manufacturers. It\u2019s designed for systems that simply cannot fail: surgical robots, autonomous forklifts, or factory arms handling dangerous tasks. With features such as real-time responsiveness, functional safety certification, and robust cybersecurity, QNX ensures that robots perform precisely and safely, even under complex, time-sensitive conditions.\n\nBeyond technology, China\u2019s leadership also reflects alignment between policy, industry, and workforce culture. The May 6 report notes that 81% of Chinese tech leaders are satisfied with their country\u2019s AI and robotics regulations\u2014compared with a global average of the same\u2014suggesting that regulation is not viewed as a bottleneck but as a supportive framework. Even more striking, 99% of Chinese executives believe that employees should be actively involved in decisions around robotics adoption, reinforcing the importance of trust-building not just with machines, but within teams.\n\nIn essence, China\u2019s robotics leadership is not simply a matter of technology\u2014it\u2019s a result of coordinated progress across innovation, governance, and organizational culture. And while China leads in many metrics, the global trend is undeniable: we are entering an era where robotics will fundamentally reshape how work is done. But for this transition to succeed, it must be built on trust\u2014trust in performance, in safety, and in the software that connects it all.\n\nBlackBerry QNX is positioned at the core of this shift. By delivering safe, secure, and dependable software platforms, QNX enables companies worldwide to confidently adopt robotics without compromising the well-being of workers or the reliability of operations. As industries evolve and automation accelerates, the companies that prioritize safety, trust, and strong system foundations will be the ones who define the next industrial era.\n\n\nApril 30, 2025: https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2025/qnx-esearch-reveals-77-percent-of-global-technology-leaders-trusting-of-robotics-in-the-workplace\n\nMay 6, 2025: https://m.eeworld.com.cn/ic_article/492/695581.html\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "This is absolutely incredible. A Johns Hopkins AI robot just performed part of a **gallbladder removal with 100% precision and zero human intervention**. The system learned solely from surgical videos and verbal commands, adapting in real time like a human surgeon would.\n\nThis isn't just a medical breakthrough - it's proof that AI can master complex, high-stakes physical tasks through observation alone. The robot didn't need specialized training data or thousands of practice runs. It watched surgery videos and figured out how to operate on a living person with perfect precision.\n\nThe implications are staggering. If AI can learn surgery from videos, what other skilled professions are about to be revolutionized? This technology could bring world-class surgical care to remote areas where specialists aren't available. But it also means we're approaching a world where AI doesn't just assist humans - it can fully replace them in tasks requiring judgment, dexterity, and real-time adaptation. The fact that this happened with current technology means we're probably just years away from AI surgeons being better than human ones.",

You realize that a huge section of internal medicine is soley dedicated to surgical operations consisting of pinching, sealing, bisecting, and suturing intestinal tissues in a variety of ways right? The little flap of skin in the video is only meant to illustrate the capability of the machine to work with gastrointestinal/epithelial sections in this regard. The speed, precision, and especially possible adaption into laparoscopic deployment are the key selling points. Also that head shown apparently replaces the need for the slower, traditional needle/needle holder arrangement for simple suturing jobs. Surgeons look at this shit and get hard, they don't see it as endangering their jobs.\n\nSource: surgical technician with working exposure to the da Vinci instrument series.  ",

Removing the surgeon from that decision tree would require incredible, impossible effort to prove to regulators that the system was safe.\n\nWith the article doesn't mention is that you would have to also convince surgeons that replacing them with a robot is in the best interest of the patient, and it is generally not in a surgeon's best financial interest to be convinced of that.",

In most cases, a medical board consisting of _the physicians who work at that hospital_ determine what procedures are safe and may be performed at that hospital.  Further, since liability insurance for medical procedures comes from the doctors, if you replace the doctors judgment with a machine of your choosing, anything bad that happens becomes your fault. *Nobody* in hospital administration wants to stand up in front of a court and say that _they overrode their medical committee, fired their doctors and replaced them with unthinking machines, and therefore whatever bad thing just happened is \"not their fault\"_.  Anyone saying that might as well bring their own cross, then distribute nails and hammers to the jury.\n\nSecond, any company whose sales pitch is \"We make products that let you fire your expensive doctors\" will find themselves buried in bad publicity from a very wealthy profession.  In the medical device field, this would be corporate suicide. No company is going to be willing to fall on this sword, so we're almost certainly going to stick with the status quo for the foreseeable future.\n\nEdit: typos",

Our society had been unchanged for millions of years, no change was possible any longer as far as everyone could determine. We had resigned ourselves to our society, our culture, and hateful biology. Like other species, tens of thousands, millions of years was required for any movement in the homeostasis of our societies.*\n\n*Then the Great P'Thok blew a hole in our culture and Beloved Matron Mi'Luki drove an ice cream truck through it. By the time we had settled down, by the time war was averted by the very things that changed our society, the Terran-Mantid Wars were over, the Republic, the Combine, even the Imperium had fallen. The Digital Omnimessiah had been assassinated and the Biological Apostles, the Immortals, had vanished.*\n\n*In the time it took us to decide if Blueberry Cream Powersmoker Flavor should be legal for certain age groups of Matrons, the Fourth Republic had fallen and the Concordiant had risen to power.*\n\n*Terran society* always *had a Great P'Thok, there were Beloved Matron Mi'Luki's everywhere.*\n\n*For us, it was ice cream, birth control, and cigarettes.*\n\n*For Terrans, it was simply being a Terran.* \\- From: *Reflections Upon Change*, philosopher P'latret, 545 PG\n\nThe hospital room was quiet, just a low hum of electronics and the gentle whisper of the environmental system that kept the room at the optimum temperature for the patient's health and keeping down the spread of microorganisms through temperature regulation.\n\nNormally two species did not share a room, but this room had a null-g hospital bed for a small green mantid tucked up next to a larger bed for a Hakanian. The Hakanian twisted and writhed, despite the anesthetic beam, moaning out loud and muttering fragments of speech. The green mantid would jerk, his three legs scrabbling, the regen cast where the missing leg had been clicking now and then, and data would stream down the computer screens.\n\nOn the other side of the viewing window, in the observation room, stood a gold mantid, a russet mantid, and a Rigellian female, one a psychic surgeon, one a medical surgeon, the other a Defense Services Intelligence Agency officer. Against the wall stood two women, short, thick bodied, black hair, in suits and apparently unarmed, their gunmetal gray eyes staring straight ahead.\n\nConfederate Intelligence Agents.\n\nThe gold mantid opened a window in the smartglass and scrolled through the data.\n\n\"The dream blocker medication is working somewhat, but those aren't dreams, they're implanted memories,\" the gold mantid, one *Finds Common Ground*, said. She shook her head. \"I'll tell you the truth, I'm somewhat concerned about what you're asking me to do.\"\n\nThe russet mantid, one *Never Give You Up*, nodded. \"We need you to seal off the implanted memories so that we can at least ask how the patient came into possession of them.\"\n\nOn cue the maimed features of the Atrekna with the burning red eyes appeared on the dream monitor and the Hakanian gave a low moan of pain and terror.\n\n\"An Enraged Atrekna,\" the russet mantid said softly, shaking her head and tapping the tips of her cybernetically enhanced bladearms together. \"There is a high probability that the injuries to his face and head and hand were incurred in combat against a Terran.\"\n\nThe Rigellian female nodded, rubbing the knuckles of one hand with the palm of another, trying to ease her anxiety at the sight of the Atrekna as the remaining feeding tentacles writhed slowly and obscenely and the eyes drew closer until they blottted out everything else.\n\n\"Has there been a record of Atrekna freeing any prisoners?\" *Finds* asked.\n\n\"No,\" the Rigellian, one Tiffany Gawarkrawk, said quietly. \"Nor has there ever been any sightings of an Atrekna like the one that delivered the patient to the SAR platoon.\"\n\n*Finds* sighed deeply, reaching out and putting a hand against the smartglass wall and closing her eyes. Her antenna flicked back and forth for a moment then steadied. A low silvery purple nimbus surrounded her antenna.\n\n\"His mental defenses are sliced apart. Not with brute force, this was done by someone skilled. I'd say the red-eyed Atrekna is experienced at this,\" the gold one said. She suddenly shuddered and pulled back. \"I can taste Red Eyes all over the thoughts.\n\nShe paused for a moment.\n\n\"It's Enraged. One taste of his phasic touch and you can feel it. Not as bad as a non-Enraged Terran, but you can still taste it,\" *Finds* said. She shook her head again. \"Prepare a psychic surgery theater and alert a psychic surgery team.\"\n\nShe closed the data window.\n\n\"I'll try to see if he's still in there.\"\n\n\\-----\n\n*small*\n\n*silent*\n\n*still*\n\nYrler floated in a dark bubble. Images kept appearing, rubbing against the walls of the bubble. He ignored them even as another part of his brain screamed in terror, in agony, the screams translating into low moans through the medication.\n\nHe was in the fetal position, wrapped up, eyes closed, ears pressed against the side of his head, tail protecting his butt crack and genitals as it arced beneath him.\n\n*small*\n\n*still*\n\n*silent*\n\n\"Does. It. Hurt?\" the strange voice of the naked Atrekna, sounding like a badly recorded female lemur.\n\n*small*\n\n*still*\n\n*silent*\n\nYrler didn't know what was happening to his body.\n\nIt didn't matter.\n\nHe was somewhere else now. Beyond his body. Beyond safe memories. Beyond everything to the point that nothing could truly reach him.\n\n*survive*\n\n*escape*\n\n*resist*\n\n*evasion*\n\nHe was within all three. He had survived his injuries so far, had survived those razor sharp fingers rooting through his memories, his thoughts, touching his soul.\n\nHe had escaped their touch, their punishments on his already battered body, their assaults upon his mind.\n\nHe couldn't feel his body any longer but that was good.\n\nHe had escaped beyond their reach.\n\nHe was past resisting. His memories were his own, but they were disconnected, no longer attached, protected by the fact that his brain no longer processed memories, no longer made neural function calls to his long term, mid-term, or even short term or immediate memory clusters.\n\nHe resisted by having escaped.\n\n*small*\n\n*still*\n\n*silent*\n\nHe could evade them now. He was beyond them, outside their reach.\n\nFree. Candy?\n\nThe memory whispered at him, a distorted female lemur voice, but it wafted past him like an ill wind and he paid it no mind.\n\nHe was the bubble on the night sea, the pollen in the night air.\n\n*small*\n\n*silent*\n\n*still*\n\nHe knew he was screaming somewhere else. Knew he was writhing in pain.\n\nBut he had escaped the pain.\n\nHe floated in warm blackness, curled into the fetal position.\n\n\"Peflar? Pelfar? Can you hear me?\" reverberated through the darkness.\n\n*small*\n\n*silent*\n\n*still*\n\nYrler felt himself slowly rotate. Heard the faint pleasant gurgle of bubbles in dark warm water.\n\n\"Pelfar? I'm Doctor *Finds the Common Ground.* Can you hear me? You're in a Confederate Military Medical Center. Pelfar?\"\n\n*the enemy will attempt to trick you. reject their words even if it is just simply ignoring them. listen but let the words pass through you. do not reply do not engage until you see your opportunity*\n\n\"Pelfar? I'm Doctor *Finds the Common Ground*. I'm a psychic surgeon. I suspect you are in here. Please respond.\"\n\n*small*\n\n*silent*\n\n*still*\n\n*resist*\n\n*evade*\n\n*survive*\n\nYrler ignored it all, not even dignifying the enemy's attempt with a response, his mind blank, as he floated inside the bubble.\n\n\\-----\n\n\"He's still in there,\" *Finds* said. \"I can't find him, but he's in there.\"\n\n\"SERE training,\" the Rigellian said. She tapped the smartglass. \"He's been trained in psychic warfare counter-measures. He won't respond unless you give the correct key phrases.\"\n\n\"You should give them to me so I can bring him out of it,\" *Finds* said.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Gawarkrawk shook her head. \"Not yet. His brain, his thoughts, his *mind* was touched by a creature we know almost nothing about. It ripped apart his mind and implanted memories,\" she tapped the smartglass and brought up the image of the disfigured red-eyed Atrekna. \"Old Red-Eyes here was enraged to boot. Think about that. He had an Atrekna, arguably more skilled than even your people, root around in his brain *and* the Atrekna was Enraged.\"\n\nLTC Gawarkrawk shifted the screen slightly to show the green mantid. \"You can try him.\"\n\n\\-----\n\n515 lay on the rock, sunning himself. Around him a holoprojector was playing his favorite song.\n\n*one and one is two two and two is four four and four is eight eight quacky duckies swim with four hopping frogs singing two songs in one pond warm blanket soft blanket red block is square blue triangle is blue green circle is funny*\n\nHe was tiny. No bigger than a credit chip. His implants were the size of grains of sand, mostly nonfunctional, the nanotech systems growing slowly with him.\n\nHe could sense the spectral output of the star, taste the chemical composition of the particles on the wind, see the stresses the wind put on the stalks of purple grass beneath a violet sky.\n\n\"Five One Five! Are you in there?\" the voice asked from far away.\n\n*spooky sounds are spooky but you are safe with broodmommy* the song sang\n\n\"Five One Five, this is *Finds the Common Ground*, please respond.\"\n\n515 just ignored it, closing his eyes, turning off his antenna.\n\n*warm greenie smart greenie clever greenie safe greenie*\n\nThe song wound around him, moved through him, lifted him beyond.\n\nHe knew that part of his mind was screaming, shrieking out the equations carved into his mind by the burning razored edge of the red-eyed Atrekna's mind domination.\n\nBut he was beyond that.\n\n*smart greenie clever greenie one and one is two two and two is four four and four is eight*\n\nThe song continued as he ignored the voice.\n\nIt was the enemy. An enemy trick.\n\nThe red eyed Atrekna and its bizarre friends would not break him. He would not comply. He would not answer.\n\nHe was 515.\n\nAnd he was warm and smart and clever and brave\n\n*smart greenie clever greenie brave greenie*\n\n\\-----\n\n\"I can't reach him. He's so far down I'm not even sure he's conscious,\" *Finds* said.\n\nLTC Gawarkrawk noted that the gold mantid looked exhausted.\n\n\"Those equations he keeps repeating, they're branded into his psyche with a blowtorch.\"\n\n\"Do we know what they are?\" LTC Gawarkrawk asked, turning to one of her aides.\n\n\"Vaguely, yes. Precisely, no,\" the Kobold said.\n\n\"Give me a gist?\" the Colonel asked.\n\nThe Kobold shrugged. \"We believe a lot of it is data on the hyperatomic plane that we now know as Hellspace. There's a lot of technical data that the greenies just stare at in shock. Something about a hyperparticle energetic state non-linear accellerator or something like that,\" the Kobold gave a laugh. \"I'm a trained jumpspace and hyperspace theory scientist and those equations make my eyes cross,\" he paused. \"Another problem is, three quarters of the data is in the same language that the patient keeps mumbling.\"\n\n\"Which we still don't understand,\" LTC Gawarkrawk cursed, slamming a closed fist against the smartglass.\n\n\"It's being theorized that it might be ancient Lanaktallan. From the Precursor War,\" another intelligence specialist said, this one a Pubvian. \"That's our best bet.\"\n\n\"Let me guess, the Unified Council might have had spaceships from back then, but nobody speaks that old language,\" LTC Gawarkrawk snarled. \"Great. Something this important and it's a dead-end because nobody alive speaks Precursor War Lanaktallan. Nobody speaks the right language, including the advanced mathematics because of lost concepts.\"\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\nOne of the women against the wall cleared her throat and took a half-step forward.\n\nEveryone turned and stared.\n\n\"That's not... necessarily true,\" the Agent said.\n\n\\-----\n\n*Dreams of Something More* watched as the massive Herd Stallion entered her quarters.\n\nIt was a glossy black biomechanical nightmare to many. Covered in sleek black armor, pistons and gears and pullies visible here and there, its feet wreathed in flame, it's six eyes burning purplish-red, it's feeding tendrils tipped with shining chrome.\n\nTo the Lanaktallan, it was strength, progress, imposing and impressive.\n\nIt reminded *Dreams* of the work of a few Terran artists.\n\nThe massive black Lanaktallan nodded gravely.\n\n\"You wished to hold audience with me, Madame Diplomat?\" the huge black stallion asked, his voice cultured and smoothed, his Confederate Standard Interspecies Common Speech flawless.\n\n\"Yes,\" *Dreams* said. She made a motion and a starmap opened up. \"You're familiar with the current state of the Atrekna War?\"\n\nThe stallion nodded. \"Operation Iron Piglet and all of its operational offensives seemed like an impossible insanity to me. The idea that the Confederacy already had all of that military might in Council Space or bordering it seemed impossible.\"\n\n\"No species has ever been prepared for our war machine, whether it was the Confederacy's or the governments preceding it,\" *Dreams* said, nodding.\n\n\"Everyone is a gangster until the crude directional mine carrying domestic cleaning robot comes around the corner,\" the Lanakallan Herd Stallion rumbled.\n\n*Dreams* smiled and nodded. \"An old saying, but applicable.\"\n\n\"There has been a development,\" *Dreams* said. \"One that I believe you can help with.\"\n\nThe Herd Stallion's body language showed curiosity. \"I am willing to assist if I can.\"\n\n\"Can you speak the ancient Lanaktallan tongue. Not Unified Standard Language, but the ancient tongue of your people from the Percursor War?\" *Dreams* asked.\n\nThe Lanaktallan managed to display sorrow even though his face was a plated mask. \"Alas, I can read it, but I cannot speak it. I am willing to try to listen to see if it is understandable to me.\"\n\n*Dreams* nodded and reached out. \"Be warned, there's psychic imprinting with the speech that we've been unable to parse.\"\n\n\"I am warned,\" the huge Lanaktallan stated.\n\nThe whisper was low, pain filled, as it wound through the artificially generated temperate rain forest that filled *Dreams's* quarters.\n\n\"It is a message of grave importance, that ignoring will bring doom and wide-spread death and destruction,\" the Lanaktallan stated, his eyes closed. \" The phasic messaging is that the message must be attended to, attention to it is of great importance. The Atrekna are desperate and willing to attempt the unthinkable that will be vast and terrible in its destruction.\"\n\nThe message ended.\n\n\"The words, I understood a few. It mentioned the Atrekna several times, there were scientific phrases I did not understand, but I was able to glean the meaning behind the words,\" the Lanaktallan stated. It shuddered. \"A great project, committed by my people, who faced extinction at the hands of the Autonomous War Machines of all three of the Great Triumviant.\"\n\n\"The PAWM,\" *Dreams* said\\*.\\* She suddenly sat up straight. \"Oh, my Digital Omnimessiah and the Twelve Biological Apostles,\" she breathed. \"It's about the creation of Hellspace!\"\n\nThe Lanaktallan nodded. \"I believe you are correct, Madame Diplomat. I had deduced the same thing,\" it shook its great head solemnly. \"Sadly, there is nobody I know of that would understand the engineering from back then. Terms matter with advanced science, and I am not sure just how much we can glean from those whispers.\"\n\n*Dreams* nodded. \"Thank you, Honored One.\"\n\nThe Lanaktallan bowed slightly. \"I but live to serve the Lanaktallan people.\"\n\n\"Now we just need to figure out how to find someone who can understand the language better and who knows engineering from back then,\" *Dreams* mused.\n\n\"I wish you good fortune on your search,\" the Herd Stallion said.\n\n\\-----\n\nThe sun was warm, a light air current, stronger than a breeze but lighter than wind, floated in from the west, carrying the smell of grain, cattle, and water. The crops waved slowly, a long undulation reminiscent of an ocean. The sky was dotted with white puffy clouds, clear violet to the senses of the few sentient beings on the scattered farms and ranches.\n\nOn one such farm slash ranch a massive Mantid warrior caste sat in a rocker, leaning back against the swivel backrest, idly swinging his four legs lazily to make the chair rock back and forth. He had a floppy hat on, holes cut for his sensitive antenna, as well as a leather abdominal wrap, denim vest, and a buckskin satchel on a bead decorated strap.\n\nIn his lap sat a fat and pampered fowl, that was slowly being petted with bladearms sharp enough to slice through endosteel. It was making low gobbling noises of happiness as the huge mantid petted it.\n\nAround him, relaxing on small bench-seats with adjustable back rests, were a half dozen green servitors. They were discussing, in their mathematical language, repairs done to one of the tractors.\n\nThe massive Mantid warrior, Cordexen by name, felt pride in the engineering servitors.\n\nHe enjoyed hearing their chatter.\n\nIt banished the loneliness he had suffered for eons.\n\nA pinging from inside the house got his attention and he sighed as he set the snoring turkey down and stood up, the back of the rocking chair automatically swinging out of the way.\n\nHe entered his large house, tapping bladearms with a war servitor who was sitting on the couch with a half dozen other black carapace mantids, all watching the edutainment show \"Uncle Mikey\" on the Tri-Vee.\n\nIn the communications room the comlink was pinging steadily.\n\nIt was slightly surprising to see that it wasn't one of his neighbors or one of the Mantid with whom he had shared the terrible purgatory of the underground mining installation.\n\nIt was a call from Confederate Intelligence.\n\nHe had no fear as he reached for the accept button. Confederate Intelligence had held little interest for him. Cordexen was more afraid of the media channels and media stars who had wanted to interview him than of CI.\n\nThe screen wavered and cleared to show a gold mantid.\n\nCordexen blinked several times.\n\nShe was different than he was used to. Less spikes. Larger head. Longer antenna. Bigger eyes. The carapace angles and lines were different.\n\n\"I am *Finds the Common Ground*, a Confederate Armed Services Military Doctor, a psychic surgeon to be precise. May we speak, oh honored elder cousin?\" the gold asked, the translator built into the wondrous comlink translating her speech from Confederate Standard (according to the subtitle) to proper Krikitak Imperial Vocalization.\n\nCordexen briefly considered shutting off the comlink. She was from another Hive, another bloodline, and the feeling of loss that welled up inside of him was almost stifling.\n\nInstead, he just slowly nodded.\n\n\"You fought mainly against the Lanaktallan, correct?\" the gold mantid asked, ignoring the breach of protocol in Cordexen not introducing himself.\n\nAgain, Cordexen just nodded.\n\n\"Can you understand the Lanaktallan spoken word?\" *Finds* asked.\n\nCordexen could sense her anxiety, her almost despairing hope, even through the light year gap in the hypercom signal.\n\nAgain, he nodded.\n\n\"Would you be willing to translate?\" the gold one asked. She blinked twice and Cordexen noted she had a few green freckles on her eyelids.\n\nShe would have been tossed into the larval pits for that imperfection by the Krikitak Empire.\n\nAgain, Cordexen nodded after standing perfectly still for nearly a minute.\n\n\"Another question, honored elder cousin, if I may?\" the gold asked.\n\nCordexen held still for a long moment.\n\nOne of his prize turkeys waddled into the room and rubbed against his leg, making happy gobbling noises.\n\nCordexen bent down and lifted it up in his hands, petting it slowly with his bladearm.\n\nFinally, he nodded.\n\n\"Do you know anyone who understands Lanaktallan engineering in its original language from your time?\" the gold asked.\n\nCordexen swallowed bitter ichor and ash.\n\n*the rifles flashing as the green servitors worked furiously trying to shut off the rampaging lanaktallan autonomous war machine even as its weapons ripped and tore at the metropolis the scream of machines and mantid the roar of mechanical foes and his own weapons his engineer servitors working furiously spurred on by his own desperation as he and his war servitors pushed the lanaktallan killing machines back with sheer firepower*\n\nCordexen opened his eyes.\n\n\"I apologize greatly for causing you such distress, honored elder cousin,\" the gold said. \"It give me physical pain to know I am causing distress, but this is of such vital importance that I was granted permission to speak with you.\"\n\nCordexen nodded even as he gently petted the happy turkey.\n\n\"You do?\" the gold sagged slightly with relief. She looked back up. \"Honored elder cousin, the entire galactic arm, even beyond, is threatened by machinations of the Atrekna that were revealed by this data.\"\n\nCordexen said nothing, just stood there, facing the hologram, petting Corey the Turkey.\n\n\"Do you wish to know what it is about before you agree to allow me to transmit the data?\" the gold asked.\n\nCordexen thought about it, looking to his left, where sunshine was streaming through a gap in the curtains, making a beautiful violet block on the wood.\n\nFinally he turned back and nodded.\n\n\"A neural imprint copy of Lanaktallan scientists talking about burning the hyperatomic plane as well as a large amount of engineering data,\" the gold said. \"There is additional speech we cannot identify. As you know, it has been over a hundred and twenty million years since those events.\"\n\nCordexen stared at the violet rectangle of light on the floor.\n\nOne of the engineer servitors came in and held up a stalk of wheat to Cordexen.\n\nCordexen bent down and took it, expressing thanks and pleasure, and stroked the servitor for a moment before it rushed off. He stood up slowly, putting the stalk in his mandibles and staring at the gold.\n\n\"Will you allow us to transmit the data to you?\" the gold asked.\n\nCordexen nodded slowly. He stayed silent as the data packet was transferred.\n\nBefore the gold could say anything more, Cordexen went and shut off the call, leaving the data channel open.\n\nHe walked quietly out to the porch, sitting down and staring at his crops, at his cattle, and feeling sadness well up inside of him.\n\n*Bedamned all programmers, scientists, and engineers that were so filled with pride they doomed us all twice,* Cordexen thought to himself, staring at the waving stalks. *What you have wrought still ravages the universe even after the stars you saw in the sky have gone out.*\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/uctp91/first_contact_chapter_760_the_inheritors_war/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ue7gqt/first_contact_chapter_762_the_inheritors_war/)\\]  - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

    "title": "For those considering Cardiac Surgery I6 Residency Programs- Plus all my compiled Gossip about various programs.",
    "selftext": "I'm a Board Certified General Surgeon, currently in CT Fellowship.\n\nI've mentored dozens of medical students over the years.  I've talked to many residents I6 programs, and have many friends in CT Fellowships.\n\nThis post is written for all of the medical students who are looking at I6 and General Surgery Programs, and is based off of personal opinion.  Take it for what it's worth (perhaps very little)\n\nFirst off, broad generalizations:  the General Surgery-> CT fellowship pathway is long, but produces a relatively consistent product.  It has many off-ramps.  If you get 3 years in, have some kids, and decide that Cardiothoracic life is not for you, you can do breast surgery, or ACS, or hernias, or any of a million different off-ramps with differing lifestyles.  CT has far fewer off-ramps.  If you do CT, you better be committed to operating, a lot, to maintain your skills.  If your skills deteriorate, your patients WILL do worse, and this will be noticed.  No one really cares if you take an hour to do a lap chole instead of 30 minutes.  Your patient's heart cares a lot if the cross clamp time for a bypass is 2 hours instead of 1.\n\nThat said, the 2 year CT fellowships (and some 3 year...) do not truly train fellows to perform the full breadth of adult CT.  There are procedures that almost no 2 year fellowship grads and very few 3 year fellowship grads are truly qualified to do off the bat- robotic mitrals, Davids, Ross, thoracoabdominal aorta, etc.\n\nSOME I6 programs DO get you ready to perform these rare procedures as a fresh residency grad.  Some don't.\n\nWhich brings me to the theme of I6: YMMV.  Some I6 programs are amazing.  Which stands to reason- \\~4.5 years of cardiac surgery is going to make you better at cardiac than 2 years of it.  BUT, how much you do during those 4 years may be very variable, and what you graduate doing may be similar to what a traditional fellowship grad does (most programs), significantly less (if you're screwed with bad faculty), and occasionally significantly more.\n\nCT departments are smaller than General Surgery.  The loss of 1-2 key faculty can have massive negative impacts.  The gain of 1-2 faculty who care about teaching can be massive bonuses.  For traditional CT fellowships, over 2-3 years, you can expect some stability.  Not so for I6, with 6-8 years with one department.  Good I6 programs have become trash (and to be fair, vice versa) due to this phenomenon.\n\nWith that in mind, if you're hell bent on I6, great.  But also be warned: it's growing increasingly harder to match general surgery/dual apply, as many \"high quality\" general surgery programs will not rank anyone they don't think will rank them highly/#1- which by definition includes all I6 applicants.  Only a few general surgery programs will even consider students claiming they are interested in Cardiac surgery (more will consider thoracic-interested students).\n\nWhich is another point: in general, if you are doing a lot of rotations alongside general surgery residents, that's actually a negative.  One of the smartest things Columbia and UPenn did was send their I6 residents out to community hospitals to operate.  Otherwise, they will end up being scut-monkeys on their gen surg months, since gen surg chiefs will naturally prioritize general surgery categoricals for OR opportunities.\n\nNow, onto programs:\n\nColumbia: solid reputation for clinical training.  Heavy work hours, but graduates come out very well trained.\n\nMt. Sinai: Rumor has it the graduates don't get to do much, which is sad since Mt Sinai is basically the mecca for the Ross procedure in the United States.\n\nNYU: Same as Mt Sinai- high volume center, graduates generally dissatisfied with autonomy, but they have yet to graduate a chief- maybe it will be better once the faculty get used to training I6 residents/the chief I6 resident gets an amazing amount of autonomy their final year, which is often the case.\n\nBrigham: Program still in shambles ever since Larry Cohn died.  Tolis has a phenomenal reputation as a teaching surgeon from MGH, but he's one guy and he doesn't let the residents do much due to objections to frequent rotations/lack of continuity with one trainee.\n\nMaryland: Decent training.  Surprisingly more academic than Hopkins across the street- they did the first pig transplant.  Hopkins' CT program was in shambles, but is being aggressively rebuilt ironically by the guy passed over for the position of Chief at Maryland.  TBD, but I think you're trained well\n\nEmory: Solid reputation, good training, graduates seem happy and autonomous.  Traditional fellowship (3 year) is known for being slow to give autonomy but they certainly get you there in the end.  I6 is apparently solid in terms of training.\n\nBaylor: Legendary reputation. Middling satisfaction with training, though I6 reportedly getting a better experience than the traditional fellowship, which is on probation.\n\nUPenn: Not as great as it used to be since Bavaria left, but perhaps it's recovered.  Used to be amazing.\n\nNorthwestern: Used to be phenomenal.  Unfortunately, a new chair took over from McCarthy, and shifted the focus from education to production, which means 3 cases/day in a room, less time for trainees to learn.\n\nUC Davis: Not great ever since a core faculty (Victor Rodriguez) left.  Apparently solid thoracic training for what it's worth.\n\nStanford: Joe Woo openly states that CT surgeons are born, not made.  Which means that he will decide if you are \"trainable\" or not, and if not, he will consign you to doing TAVRs and not operating. Quite sad, given it's legendary reputation. BUT, if you're considered \"born\" to be a surgeon, you will be very well trained and handed the keys to the kingdom.\n\nUSC: Phenomenal training- significantly above what is reported by other residents nationwide.  PGY2s reportedly doing CABGs skin to skin, faculty dedicated to taking the time to train as directed by Vaughn Starnes.  That said, brutal culture and hours.  Be warned.\n\nCeders-Sinai: Solid training.  Chikwe put a twitter post out showing a PGY2 doing a mitral repair, which the residents there state was mostly staged/bullshit, but they are on the whole operating and learning quite well.\n\nCleveland Clinic: Extremely chaotic, very busy, attendings not very focused on teaching and also have an army of super-fellows.  Several residents not too happy with training, but some exceptions.\n\nTake this for what it's worth.  Best wishes to all on figuring out what to do and where to train.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFrom another poster:\n\nBrigham - only recently has had i6 grads so hard to tell what the product of the i6 program is. but traditional fellows (both 4/3 and 5/2) do not seem to come out as well trained compared to some of the other options you listed (though, this is likely true of many other i6 programs where you've got both other training tracks). as you mentioned is the case for traditional training programs, they can come out able to do cabg and avr, but definitely not the more complex stuff without a fellowship. things may change now that sundt has taken over as MGB chief but hard to really tell.\n\ncolumbia: chiefs graduate as excellent technical surgeons, able to do complex aortic work with zero issues. only question is heart failure because they have advanced fellows for that, but they still get plenty of experience with transplant and mcs. outstanding faculty dedicated to teaching. senior residents always on the right side of the table. also, senior residents actually have a pretty good lifestyle since they don't round on patients. no one questions whether a columbia grad can operate. huge financial support from the department since chair is a CT surgeon.\n\npenn: disagree that it has gone massively downhill since bavaria left. yes they certainly lost volume from that, but they are still very busy with aortic work thanks to desai and some other new faculty. culture there will stay the same since szeto was trained by acker. similar to columbia, the resident is always on the right side of the table for every case. there is turnover at penn but many of their new faculty trained there so there is the same dedication to teaching. residents come out fully ready to practice in any setting.\n\n  \nAlso, comments on UMich and Yale can be found below",

It was a quikbuild structure, put up by ants almost as an afterthought, a place for beings to eat and relax a little while. Treana'ad made jokes and puffed at their cigarettes underneath air circulators/filters. Mantid talked about the last drop and how it was better/worse than this one. Rigellian females talked and sang as they ate, their conversation often about the beauty of an oiled brown feather. The Telkans stared around them at everyone talking and laughing.\n\nThey were three days into a hard drop.\n\nTask Force Angry Duck, Sixteenth Army, V CORPS (MIXED), and 1st Telkan Marine Division, First Regiment had arrived barely in time to hold off the wave after wave of Precursor metal from overwhelming the planet. Rather than leave when the math said, they kept bringing in additional waves while the previous forces retreated. They were making heavier use of drop-troops, going for the ground pound to secure victory. Space was still contested, with Task Force Angry Duck joined by Task Force Black Hammer, the latter following the Precursor vessels when they ran for it.\n\nGround was still anyone's game.\n\nThe world was rich in iridium and lithium, gravity well spun crystals with atmospheric doping making the material a hard sought resource.\n\nWhich meant whoever wanted it had to take it.\n\nThe Precursor Autonomous War Machines were a mix of Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III Hybrids. A nasty mix with a whole passel of tricks up their metal sleeves.\n\nThe Telkan were on their first offworld combat deployment. They were doing well, up to the standards of Confederate Space Force, their casualties low. Most of all, they knew when to call in for close air, artillery, or infantry support when things started to get dicey.\n\nA single Telkan came into the mess hall and the rest of the Telkan went quiet. The fur on his ears, around the tip of his muzzle, around his eyes, was all silver. He walked with a limp, one eye and one ear were black warsteel replacements. The Telkan went back to eating, quietly, as the new arrival went through the chow line and got a tray of food before moving over to sit with the handful of Terran Descent Human officers sitting at the table.\n\nColonel Iisak nodded to the Telkan officer, who nodded back and went to clearing his tray. The human noted that the Telkan's fur had the slick plastic look of someone who had just gone through the showers to wash away hours of suit-sweat. While the Telkan was eating the other officers made small talk, mostly about the condition of their units and how well the fight was going.\n\nFinally the Telkan officer pushed back his tray and picked up a long stalk of greenish red plant to nibble on.\n\n\"How's it look out there, Lieutenant?\" Colonel Iisak asked.\n\n\"Looks like we've got them on the run,\" The Telkan said. His voice was rough and coarse, like he'd been chewing gravel all day. \"Third Armor's rolling on drop points the AWM's are using, pushing them back to the Graveyard. My Brigade is rotating back for some R&R.\"\n\nThe Colonel nodded. The Graveyard was where a dozen of the larger Precursors that were able to come into the atmosphere had landed and then had been disabled by General Trucker's heavy tanks and atomic strikes from 8th Infantry during the initial landing of V Corps. The dead AWM's were still spitting out smaller war machines, but now there was the opportunity to push them back into the Graveyard and then the Harvester Class AWM's could be handled.\n\n\"How's the weather?\" General Hwrawkar asked, setting down her glass of juice. She was in charge of a Regiment of fast attack grav-strikers and, like most pilots, almost obsessed over the weather.\n\n\"Starting to cool off. Had some bad black rain yesterday, lots of heavy metal in it,\" the Telkan said. \"Wasn't too bad on the way back.\"\n\nThe Rigellian nodded, closing her eyes and bringing up her command console with her implant and ordering the mechanics to double-check the radiation shielding on all the strikers.\n\n\"How's our hosts?\" The sole one star General asked. He knew the answers his staff had given him, but it was always good to hear from another source.\n\nPlus, the young Telkan male was a newly minted officer. Sure, he could fight, he could inspire his troops, but leadership was more than yelling battlecries and pulling the trigger.\n\n\"Still staying low,\" the Telkan said. \"It's all too much for them still.\"\n\n\"Their females and young are fragile,\" Hwrawkar mused, opening her eyes. \"Something I can empathize with.\"\n\nThe male Telkan nodded.\n\n\"How are your men?\" General asked, keeping his voice mild.\n\n\"Morale was a little wobbly when those city sized Harvesters landed but it's firmed back up now,\" the Telkan said. \"We've taken pretty low casualties, all things considered.\"\n\n\"How are the new suits?\" Colonel Krikitaki, Ninth Maintenance Brigade, asked mildly.\n\n\"Still shaking out. The new psychic shielding makes everyone's teeth tingle,\" the Telkan said. He shook his head. \"Funny that I fought most of the Telkan Wars with bare minimum shielding.\"\n\n\"Type-III's push psychic assaults harder than the other two,\" General Hwrawkar said. She tapped one black talon against the side of her glass. \"I'm just glad that you are as resistant to psychic attacks as we are. It is rare.\"\n\nThe Telkan officer nodded. He finished off the stalk of vegetable and nodded to everyone. \"Gentlemen. Ladies,\" he said, standing up. He gathered his tray and went to the wash rack, clearing his tray before putting it into the shelving where it would be taken back and washed.\n\nHe thought it was funny that in an age of nantites, mass reclaimation systems, and robotics, washing pots, pans, and dishes was still done by hand in the Terran military.\n\nSoldiers saluted as he made his way through the firebase, hastily constructed over the last two days while the Lanaktallan military forces had been refit to be able to fight next to the Terrans without the danger of the Terran weapons damaging Lanaktallan vessels by the mere act of firing.\n\nHe was walking behind a pair of Terran infantrymen, both of whom were mostly biological, when he saw it.\n\nThe three green dots at the base of their skull, subdermal LEDs that were roughly an inch wide, a quarter inch thick, with rounded ends, all flashed. The bottom went turned red, then the middle one lit up amber, followed by the top one turning amber.\n\n\"Soldiers, stand fast,\" the Telkan snapped, hurrying up to them.\n\nThe two infantrymen stopped, looking down at the Telkan officer and going to attention.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" the one on the left asked.\n\n\"Right now, are you suffering headaches or any other strange symptoms,\" the Telkan asked.\n\nBoth of them looked at each other and then down.\n\n\"No, sir,\" they both said.\n\n\"I need you both to come with me to medical,\" the Telkan said.\n\n\"May we ask why, Lieutenant Vuxten?\" the one on the right asked after checking the Telkan's rank and nametag.\n\n\"Your SUDS telltales just went off green,\" the Telkan said. \"Come with me.\"\n\nBoth men put their hands on the back of their necks and nodded.\n\nVuxten hurried down the passageway, stopping three times more when he saw Terrans with the same thing on their SUDS telltales.\n\nSome soldiers were still green, some were flashing green.\n\nVuxten activated his comlink, tuning into the command channel.\n\n\"Base, get me medical,\" Vuxten snapped.\n\nThe comlink rang twice before it was answered.\n\n\"Captain Davis-Klikatik, 27th Med,\" a woman answered.\n\n\"Lieutenant Vuxten, 1st Telkan, I've got nine Terran soldiers with blown out SUDS,\" he waved at three other humans, stopping them. He glanced at the back of their necks. \"Twelve now. We're under attack.\"\n\n\"It's happening all over base. There's a general recall for all forces not engaged with the enemy to pull back,\" the medical officer said, her voice tight with stress.\n\n\"Should I bring them into Medical?\" Vuxten asked.\n\n\"Negative. Tell them to return to their muster area,\" the doctor said. \"MedCom out.\"\n\n\"Vuxten, out,\" he said. He turned to the gathered up soldiers. \"MedCom wants you to return to your barracks or muster area unless you get instructions otherwise,\" he said.\n\nThey nodded and Vuxten noted that their eyes were glowing amber. He filed the information away. He'd seen it before, during the war. Human's eyes often had a faint glow to them, but this was different.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" they said, the small knot of them dissolving as they hurried to their garrison areas.\n\nVuxten tapped his comlink again.\n\n\"General Nagwark-Tambunta, 1st Telkan,\" the human voice said.\n\n\"Sir, this is Lieutenant Vuxten,\" he answered, hurrying toward the garrison area.\n\n\"What do you need, Lieutenant?\" the General asked.\n\n\"We're under attack. SUDS are going one red two amber across the entire base. Have all human members of First Telkan checked,\" Vuxten said, squeezing by a blast door that was shutting.\n\n\"Hang on,\" the General said.\n\nVuxten noticed that the normally laconic Terran Space Force (Marines) General sounded irritated by the entire world existing.\n\n\"You're right. Vuxten, I need you to gather up all Telkan officers and meet me in Briefing Room Seven,\" the General said. \"Don't fuck around brushing your fur, you get straight there, Marine, understood?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Vuxten said.\n\nThe comlink shut off. Another surprise. Usually the General was a stickler for procedure.\n\nHe hurried faster.\n\n\\--------------------\n\n\"General Papatonis wants 3rd Armor to break contact and fall back to Log Base Tembo,\" Trucker's radioman, Sergeant Soto, called out.\n\nTrucker spit over the side, keeping the TC's gun on the target, ripping armor from the entire side of the Precursor machine. The quad-barrel found something inside of the machine and it's side blew out even as the top bulged and shed armor.\n\n\"Tell the General we're engaged with the enemy!\" Trucker yelled out. \"Fat Boy, hit that hill, three shots! There's a crawler behind it! BOLO Muttonchop, go to rapid fire on your hellbore at this angle! Second Regiment, Third Brigade, hot cycle your indirect fire forges, dump the slush!\"\n\nHe *knew* if they disengaged it would allow the flow of scrap metal flowing out of The Graveyard to overwhelm 1st Lanaktallan Armor Division through the sheer weight of numbers. It would allow the heavier machines, who had led their attack with an orbital strike into the carefully laid minefield, to break out and bypass Log Bases Tembo and Log Base Shi, which would let them flank BOLO Unit XXIX-TCSF 4721-FGY, AKA Fergy, with enough force they might be able to disable or even destroy the self-aware supertank.\n\nHis mental image of the battlefield shifted and he suddenly *knew* that elements of 528th Infantry were about to be cut off by Precursors on the other side of the hills from him. The hills were heavy in iron and granite with a river in the middle that was steaming from the heat being dumped into it by the Balor just over the curvature of the planet.\n\n\"Little Boy! Pink Pearl! Steady Lad! Fire for effect, full Shake & Bake, on these coordinates!\" Trucker shouted over his open comlink. \"Give 'em six shots of Shake & Bake then hit 'em with a scoop of Rocky Road!\"\n\nThe three tanks didn't even ask questions or doublecheck, their indirect fire crew member loading the fireplan Trucker had handed them nearly a minute ago and hitting execute.\n\n\"The General is insisting,\" the commo tech yelled.\n\n\"Tell the General that we regretfully inform him that we are ENGAGED WITH THE ENEMY!\" Trucker yelled. \"All Night Long, get in tight on Black Betty, they're about to lose their APERS strip! Cherry Fairy, hit that hulk again, there's some clanker crabs in it! Butthole Surfer, cycle your main gun, your compression chamber's whistling loud enough for me to hear it all the way over here.\"\n\nUnnoticed by Trucker, or anyone else in 3rd Armor...\n\n...the LED's flashed three times.\n\nAnd went to a stack of red burning coldly beneath the skin.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nA'armo'o watched Trucker's commands ripple through the hologram in front of him, how the battle shifted around him as if the Terran General knew what was going to happen. He watched as the General kept updating and filing fire plans that were executed sometimes up to two minutes later with devestating effect.\n\nHis Second Most High had fainted when Trucker had ordered one of the massive BOLO's riding his flanks to fire into the sky.\n\nFor a Balor to drop down out of the clouds and interference and straight into the firepower. The BOLO had gutted the Balor and it had crashed into The Graveyard.\n\nThe way Trucker orchestrated the battlefield and estimated enemy actions had proven too much for A'armo'o's second in command.\n\nA'armo'o himself watched it with interest. His own men were engaged with the light units flowing from The Graveyard, trying to reach Log Base Hota.\n\n\"General Trucker has filed a fire and maneuver plan for your approval, Great Most High,\" the Terran Digital Sentience, a reconstruction of a famous and experience Terran armor commander by the name of Torgath informed him.\n\n\"The battle is moving too fast for me. What is your opinion?\" A'armo'o asked.\n\n\"I question parts of it, as I have, but General Trucker appears to be a gifted commander. I would recommend following it,\" Torgath said, his voice stuffy.\n\n\"Then make it so,\" A'armo'o ordered.\n\nThere was silence for a second.\n\n\"Firing point defense systems, boss! Don't know...\" T'Caw started to say.\n\nThe point defense guns opened fire just above the crest of a hill a mile away.\n\nThe Precursor striker vehicles popped over the hill just in time to run into a full barrage that tore them apart in a furious set of explosions.\n\n\"...why. Oh,\" T'Caw said. \"Trucker?\"\n\n\"General Trucker,\" A'armo'o chuckled as a set of Terran strikers roared by just overhead, their guns hammering and rockets firing from beneath their stubby wings.\n\n*This* felt like a properly run war.\n\n\\------------------------\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" the Terran female asked.\n\nMo'owa'alkr was proud at himself that he didn't flinch back from her. He had thought that the amber or red light from the eyes was just from their warborgs or cybernetics, but this Terran female had biological eyes and they glowed a warm amber.\n\n\"I am slightly dizzy,\" Mo'owa'alkr said.\n\n\"That's the sedative,\" she said. \"Your surgery went well.\"\n\n\"Surgery?\" Mo'owa'alkr asked. The last thing he remembered was sitting in his fighting position and laughing.\n\n\"When you came in, we saw you had suffered some microstrokes. Precursor Scream exposure,\" the Terran said. \"We had to replace two of your eyes. We tried to save them, but the blood vessels had ruptured throughout the entire structure.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Mo'owa'alkr said. That explained the two black sections in his vision. He lifted up a glass. \"May I have some more juice?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" The Terran smiled and Mo'owa'alkr was proud of himself for not flinching. She handed him the glass. \"There's a psych tech coming to talk to you. We're worried about shell shock or combat fatigue.\"\n\nMo'owa'alkr nodded, feeling slightly ashamed.\n\n\"Hey, now,\" the Terran said. \"You did good for what you were facing.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Mo'owa'alkr said. He felt almost desperate for her approval.\n\n\"Absolutely. You were outnumbered, outgunned, and under heavy psychic assault,\" she said. She patted his upper right arm. \"Almost three hundred of your fellow troops survived with you.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Mo'owa'alkr said quietly as the nurse left.\n\nHis Herd had been nearly five thousand strong.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nTELKAN FORGE WORLDS\n\nIt's been almost two weeks.\n\nHow much longer do you think they'll be gone.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nAKLTAK FREE FLIGHT\n\nNot that long.\n\nI'm sure they'll be back.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nTNVARU GRIPPING HANDS\n\nI'm letting Terrans still in the Tnvaru Systems know that we are offering them shelter and refugee status.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nTELKAN FORGE WORLDS\n\nSame here.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nAKLTAK FREE FLIGHT\n\nI can't imagine doing anything else.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nTELKAN FORGE WORLDS\n\nI can't believe that the Unified Council thought that striking Terra would stop them.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nAKLTAK FREE FLIGHT\n\nIf anything, it'll drive them crazy.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\nTNVARU GRIPPING HANDS\n\nAgain.\n\n\\---NOTHING FOLLOWS---\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ivgdnw/first_contact_chapter_310_evil_never_dies/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ixbp3w/first_contact_chapter_312/)\\]",

    "selftext": "Robotics is revolutionizing healthcare, offering innovative solutions to complex medical challenges. Surgical robots, for example, are transforming surgeries with greater precision and improved outcomes. They perform minimally invasive procedures with smaller incisions, leading to reduced pain, shorter recovery times, and fewer complications.\n\nRehabilitation also benefits from robotics, with robotic exoskeletons helping patients regain mobility after injuries or strokes. These wearable robots assist with walking and movement, providing support and feedback for improved strength and coordination.\n\nBeyond surgery and rehabilitation, robots aid in medication delivery, patient monitoring, and eldercare. While the benefits are clear, challenges include cost, integration, and ensuring patient safety and privacy. Despite these, the future of healthcare robotics looks promising, with continued advancements set to transform the industry further.\n\n**Ethics: Exploring the Ethics of Autonomous Robots**\n\nThe rise of autonomous robots, such as vehicles and drones, raises important ethical questions. One key issue is accountability in accidents: who is responsible, the manufacturer, the programmer, or the robot itself?\n\nAnother concern is the decision-making algorithms used by autonomous robots. How do we ensure these decisions are ethical, especially in dilemmas like saving pedestrians versus vehicle occupants?\n\nThere are also concerns about the societal impact, such as job loss due to autonomous vehicles. Ensuring fair distribution of benefits and minimizing harm to certain groups is essential.\n\nThese complex questions require careful consideration and discussion as autonomous robots become more prevalent in our lives. Addressing these ethical issues is crucial to their responsible and ethical use.",

I've seen how advanced AI is getting watching 2 minute papers and if they are making the same leaps for robotic surgery as we are in 3d physics, sample shortening, time saving and operating through insane boundaries, then modern medicine is looking pretty hopeful.    I was watching a video where they had the AI driving a 2d car for some car game, but the researchers were taking away most of the visuals and the AI could still stay on course driving around enemies and making turns even with only 3% of the screen visible in micro slivers, nothing a normal person could ever hope to imagine navigating and the AI was doing it like a pro.

    "selftext": "Probably I'll be downvoted to hell but screw it. It is what it is.\n\nI've seen some replies to my posts lately, accusing Israel of being a war criminal and the root of all global issues while relying on ICC, ICJ, and B'tselem. These claims are not just misleading; they're absurd. Let's break this down rationally, starting with some context.\n\n# October 7, 2023\n\nHamas launched an unprovoked and brutal attack on Israel, killing over 1,400 civilians in one day. Families, children, and ordinary people were massacred or kidnapped. The October 7 attack wasn't an act of resistance; it was pure terrorism. Israel responded, and soon after, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen joined the fray. Let's be clear: Israel did not provoke them. These groups act as proxies for Iran, destabilizing the region under the guise of defending Palestine.\n\n# ICC and ICJ\n\n* Let's talk about the role of international organizations like the ICC (International Criminal Court) and ICJ (International Court of Justice) in perpetuating biased narratives against Israel. The ICC claims jurisdiction over Israel based on recognizing Palestine as a state, even though this recognition is far from universal, and Israel isn't a member of the court. Meanwhile, nations like Saudi Arabia, China, and Russia escape scrutiny despite significant human rights abuses because of their power and influence.\n* The ICJ, often used as a political tool, accepts referrals from nations with questionable motives. For example, resolutions against Israel are often pushed by countries like Iran and Pakistan, regimes with abysmal human rights records of their own. This selective targeting raises questions about the bias of these bodies.\n\nWhile Israel's actions are scrutinized under a global microscope, the actual atrocities in places like Syria, China, and Yemen are ignored. This inconsistency highlights the politicized nature of these institutions, undermining their credibility and objectivity.\n\n# What About B'Tselem?\n\nSome Redditors quote the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem to support their claims against Israel. Here's the thing: B'Tselem is an ultra-left outlet that freely criticizes the Israeli government. Whether or not you agree with their perspective, their existence speaks volumes about Israel's openness and democracy. Think about it: Could such an organization operate freely in China, Saudi Arabia, or Iran, where dissenters are jailed or executed? The fact that B'Tselem can openly challenge Israel's policies shows that the Israeli press and society investigate and debate its actions, a hallmark of a progressive and democratic society.\n\n# The Hypocrisy of Calling Israel the Problem\n\nIt's almost laughable to call Israel the main problem in the Middle East while ignoring what's happening elsewhere:\n\n* China detains and kills over a million Uyghur Muslims in camps and suppresses pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong. Activists are jailed or silenced, but hey, they make your phones and TVs, so there are no ICC investigations here.\n* Saudi Arabia has turned Yemen into a humanitarian disaster and assassinated a Saudi critic journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, in a consulate. Yet, it faces no significant repercussions because money talks.\n* Syria, with the help of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, has killed over half a million people using chemical weapons and barrel bombs. Entire towns are rubble, and millions are displaced, but there is no accountability.\n* Iran brutally oppresses minorities, executes protesters, and violently suppresses women's rights activists. Yet, somehow, it's still seen as credible enough to lecture others on justice and human rights.\n* Palestinian Territories, governed by Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, are rife with human rights abuses against their people. Arbitrary arrests, suppression of protests, and crackdowns on dissent are routine. Women, minorities, and political opponents often suffer the most, but these violations rarely make headlines.\n* Oh, and by the way, LGBT rights are non-existent in any of these countries; if you are gay, you either go to jail or be murdered.\n\n# The Genocide Claim\n\nThe accusation that Israel is committing genocide is not only false but a distortion of the term. Genocide refers to the deliberate and systematic extermination of a people. In contrast:\n\n* Population Growth: The Palestinian population in both Gaza and the West Bank has been steadily increasing. This alone contradicts any claim of genocide, as populations subjected to genocide do not grow; they diminish.\n* Humanitarian Measures: Despite ongoing conflict, Israel provides humanitarian aid to Gaza, including medical supplies and electricity. Israel also treats Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, even during times of heightened tensions.\n* Military Objectives, Not Ethnic Cleansing: Israel's military actions target Hamas, a terrorist organization that uses civilians as human shields rather than Palestinian civilians as a group. Precision targeting and efforts to warn civilians before strikes further demonstrate that Israel's actions are not aimed at extermination but at defense.\n\nIf Israel were truly committing genocide, you wouldn't see the kind of growth and international aid provided to Palestinian territories that exists today. This accusation diminishes the weight of actual genocides, such as those seen in Rwanda or Bosnia, by misusing the term.\n\n# The Apartheid Claim\n\nCalling Israel an apartheid state oversimplifies a complex situation. Arab citizens of Israel vote, serve in parliament, become judges, and have the same rights as Jews and other ethnicities and religions. Compare this to apartheid South Africa, where Black citizens were denied every fundamental right. The West Bank situation is challenging, but the apartheid label ignores decades of nuanced conflict.\n\n# What Israel Brings to the World\n\nWhile people scream \"Israel bad,\" they conveniently overlook Israel's contributions:\n\n* Tech? Israel revolutionized healthcare with Mazor Robotics for spinal surgeries and leads in autonomous driving with Mobileye.\n* Medicine? Breakthroughs like Exelon for Alzheimer's and cancer immunotherapy are saving lives globally. Israel's advancements in regenerative medicine, such as lab-grown organs, are shaping the future.\n* Humanitarian Aid? Israeli disaster response teams, like those deployed after earthquakes in Turkey, save countless lives with cutting-edge equipment and expertise. They prioritize humanity, even aiding nations that deny diplomatic ties.\n\n# The Bigger Picture\n\nNo country is perfect, not Israel, not any other one. Israel suffers from some levels of systemic corruption, and there is a huge divide internally on a lot of topics, especially on judiciary reforms and the lack of political stability; there is a lot to improve. But singling out Israel as the villain of the Middle East while giving a free pass to regimes like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and China is hypocritical. If you want to talk about human rights, let's at least apply the same standards to everyone.",

Any anyone who claims their side is \"right\" and the other is \"wrong\" is either uninformed or disengenious.",

The truth is, the term only became an issue when Israel took control after defending itself in a war.\n\nDuring Ottoman rule, the land wasn't 'Palestinian'. It was part of an empire. Large-scale development only began with Jewish pioneers in the late 19th century, which attracted waves of Arab migrants seeking economic opportunities.\n\nSo ask yourself, If no one called it 'Palestinian land' under Ottoman, Egyptian, or Jordanian rule, why is it suddenly an issue now?

Unlike Russia and Ukraine, Israelis genuinely live there now. \n\nComparing it to the Russia Ukraine situation isn't remotely the same. Russia is a invading its neighbor. Another sovereign state under the claim of protecting Russian speaking Ukrainians (who don't claim to be Russian) from Nazis in Kyiv.\n\nIsrael and Palestine are two separate nationalities fighting over the land they both claim to belong to them.\n\nClaims of apartheid and genocide by the palestinian side are propagandistic misrepresentation of reality to highlight Israeli maltreatment for Palestinian political gain. \n\nAparthied implies their being mistreated under a system that elevates and favors one side over the other. Which would only work if Palestinians acknowledge themselves to be part of the same country as Israel. Which they don't. So called Aparthied is Palestinians in the west bank unable to stop settlers from displacing them. And Israel pressuring the PLO to not charge Israeli settlers entering the west bank doing this. Which is a gross violation of internationally recognized Palestinian sovereign territory but not Aparthied.\n\nFurthermore the idea of Palestinians being merely victims of Zionism ignores all they've done for the sake of affirming their freedom and national goal. This was a people that nearly overthrew Jordan's king and picked sides in Lebanons civil war and got the Israelis to ruin their reputation trying to stamp them out of Lebanon. The settlement of the west bank is tragic but bear in mind they threw out the Israeli settlements in Gaza back in 2005.",

That\u2019s fair, because European Jews were the subject of one of the worst atrocities humans ever carried out - and also the victims of a large number of atrocities that are in the top 50. And there are *for sure* evil people who want to repeat - just spend some time on X. Anti-semitism is real and commonplace.\n\nHaving said that, the American genocide of American Indians is probably more instructive. While there were untold horrific massacres, the Americans mainly *talked* about land - and manifest destiny (i.e., it\u2019s about us white people, not you Indians). Regarding land there was a lot of \u201coh they abandoned it, so now it\u2019s ours\u201d or \u201coh they didn\u2019t make good use of it, and we will use it productively\u201d.\n\nNaturally the Indians fought back and the Americans responded to these \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d with superior technology and overwhelming force and resettlements - to protect the \u201csettlers\u201d and create safe buffer zones. \n\nI support Israel\u2019s right to exist.

        "body": "One thing that needs to be stated that gets glossed over or not even considered when your considering doing research on the history of the conflict between Israel and Palestine is that these two have been engaged in one of the longest and most intensive propaganda wars in the history of the world.\n\nThese two and their respective allies have spent the past 50 years trying to control the narrative to make themselves look just and the other not. Even the current propaganda and counter propaganda campaigns between Ukraine and Russia can't compare to how extensive the Israeli Palestine conflict has been politicised and propaganized by either side and how it has shaped public perceptions around the world.\n\nI don't wish to go into to much detail about it but I will say that this is a rabbit hole that will take you everywhere from Magazines in Qatar to Ivy League campuses, lobbyist groups, charaties, NGOs, academia and political movements across various countries in Europe, North America and the Middle east.\n\nThis is the most politicised ongoing conflict in the world. Masterminded by generations of short sighted oppurtunistic fuck ups by both side's leadership.",

But that's war, and Hamas started that back in 2023. Its a lot more messy in the West bank were Israelis have been going out manifest destinying their way into internationally recognized Palestinian Land. \nTo be honest seeing those Palestinians families get displaced by smug settlers moving in sucks more than bombs dropping on Gaza.\n\nI don't justify Israeli excesses but bear in mind the current most active political order among the Palestinians is Hamas. Whose stated objective is to expel all the Israelis and claim the land as theirs. Their conduct last year shows their true colors. You can bet they'll gladly do to the Israelis what is done to them and more if they could. So in the case of destroying Hamas it can't really be done without putting civilian lives on the line when you consider how densily urbanized Gaza is.\n\nThe hatred in this conflict runs deep and both sides are gladly willing to lie to the world to demonize the other and sanctify their side.",

Festivity lights were scattered about, providing decoration to the lawn. The fountain, which had borne silent witness to many plots, burbled as the water cascaded down, lit by different color lights to produce a pleasing effect.\n\nThe music was soft, tinkling, a comfortable counterpoint to the conversations, even though the majority of guests weren't used to music at all.\n\nThe guests mingled, many of them slowly overcoming their anxiety at the presence of the minority of guests. They trotted about the lawn, sipping at expensive wines and champagnes, nibbling on delicacies, the lawn comfortable beneath their hooves. Their sashes were ornamented, their vests expensive, their flank coverings lavish. The females wore jewelry that sparkled and glittered. The males wore their badges of rank and office.\n\nMingling through the crowd were the newcomers. Bipedal with only two arms, only two eyes, only facial hair adorning their flat faces. They were large, dense bone and muscle from evolving on a high gravity world, their two eyes forward facing and as intent as any predator's stare, made moreso by the intellect that shown in their eyes. Their mouths were full of meat tearing and plant grinding teeth, silent testimony that to them, anything that fit in their mouth was food. Their hands were strong, with firm, almost painful, grips. They were capable of grip strength to allow them to hold their entire body weight with their hands, and their arms were powerful enough to allow them to lift themselves up by their strong hands. Their legs were thick and muscled, power and endurance built into the muscle structure.\n\nThe majority, a four legged herbivore race, were very aware of the predators in their midst.\n\nIt was more than their physique. Their intellect was sharp, penetrating, and deductive. Many of the majority were surprised by the predator's ability to hold intelligent conversations on esoteric topics, from corporate profit margins to manufacturing techniques to military theory to philosophy and political thought.\n\nThe longer the party went on, the more nervous some became.\n\nNot just because of the predators. They were enough to cause anxiety.\n\nNo, it was the host of the party, who stood with the primate predators, often laughing at their jokes, holding intricate conversations with them, and seemingly perfectly at ease with them.\n\nThey knew the System Most High was different.\n\nNow they could see that he was not only different, he was their superior in every way.\n\nFrom the way he treated the elderly party guests, to the way he paid attention to the children who he had insisted be allowed to attend, to the way he treated the primates. The party itself was lavish, an outward sign of his power even though he was in exile, but his attitude was less that of a conquered leader and more of a temporarily displaced noble.\n\nThe Lanaktallan at the party were in awe of their host.\n\nMana'aktoo slapped the Terran female on the back as he laughed at her joke. It was a dirty, profane joke, that had left several other Lanaktallan wide eyed with shock. The punchline of \"That's not my 256 pin superconductor connector!\" had been expected but still amusing to Mana'aktoo as well as the four representatives from the two local xenospecies, all of whom enjoyed a good earthy joke.\n\nMaking his apologies, Mana'aktoo trotted away from the low ranking grav-striker mechanic and wound his way through the party-goers, slowly making his way toward Admiral Schmidt. He knew that many high ranking officials, politicians, and hanger-ons disliked his insistence that low ranking beings be invited to his parties and treated well, but the two species that made up the majority of the system's population largely worked in factories, mines, and industrial centers.\n\nThey also loved ironic juxtaposition and earthy jokes.\n\nAs far as Mana'aktoo was concerned, nearly every being at the party with any ranking could be used for reactor mass and it would only improve the function of the system.\n\nThe Admiral was laughing at the joke about the bliss seeking meditative and the out of control ore hauler that had just been told by the Maktanan mining union leader.\n\nMana'aktoo had heard the joke before and found the fact that, for all of the meditative's claims of being above the physical world and material objects, the out of control ore hauler had crushed the being to death, to be sensibly amusing.\n\n*A jocular way of reminding one another that we all live in the physical world despite our lofty claims,* Mana'aktoo thought to himself.\n\n\"Ah, Most High,\" the Maktanan said, bowing.\n\n\"Former Most High,\" Mana'aktoo corrected gently.\n\n\"Bah, that is polite fiction, even the illustrious Admiral would acknowledge that fact,\" the union boss chuckled, smoothing one ear. \"You are the leader that the Maktanan people desire. Even the Carikan have made their desire to allow you to continue your rule known to the Terrans.\"\n\n\"I am honored and humbled,\" Mana'aktoo said, pressing his four hands together.\n\n\"Well, on that note, if you two high ranking beings will excuse me,\" the union boss said, making a motion toward a richly dressed female Maktanan. \"My wife wishes I attend to her wants and desires.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Admiral said, nodding.\n\n\"Give your wife my admiration regarding her exquisite jewelry,\" Mana'aktoo said.\n\nThe union boss gave a pleased flick of his ears and hustled away.\n\n\"Your mother is looking well,\" Admiral Schmidt said, nodding toward where Mana'aktoo's mother was obviously enjoying herself talking to several female Space Force officers. \"I am gladdened to hear of her full recovery.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" Mana'aktoo answered.\n\nHis mother had developed a twisted intestine. While the Lanaktallan doctors wanted to do robotic assisted surgery the Terran Space Force had offered Mana'aktoo's mother the services of their own medical professionals.\n\nThe surgery had been entirely non-invasive. An injection of medical robots, all of them extremely tiny, two hours, and his mother had trotted out of the clinic exclaiming how she had hardly felt any discomfort.\n\n\"You mother choosing to use our medical facilities has eased a lot of anxiety toward our medical services,\" Schmidt said.\n\n\"Many of my people fear that you will treat them how they would treat you should the situation be reversed,\" Mana'aktoo said. \"Not the Maktanan or Carikan, they have much in common with your people.\"\n\nSchmidt made a non-committal noise, nodding slowly. The Admiral held up two fingers in a wait motion even though Mana'aktoo had recognized the expression on the Admiral's face. He knew it meant that the Admiral was processing a large amount of information through his implant.\n\nMana'aktoo felt a small shiver of concern but suppressed it, knowing that others were watching.\n\nThe Admiral blinked rapidly, turning to face Mana'aktoo, and again Mana'aktoo felt a slight bit of anxiety at the way the Terran's eyes glowed a soft amber.\n\nThey always had, but it had become more and more obvious even to the most unobservant over the last few months.\n\n\"Where is Most High Kulamu'u?\" the Admiral asked.\n\n\"His father became confused a little while ago, mistaking this gala for his retirement ceremony,\" Mana'aktoo said. \"Most High Kulamu'u took him home so he would be less agitated and confused.\"\n\nThe Admiral nodded. \"Is his Second Most High present?\"\n\nMana'aktoo nodded, pinging the Second Most High Plu'umo'o, letting the other Lanaktallan know he should present himself with all due haste.\n\n\"What is the situation?\" Mana'aktoo asked.\n\n\"Task Force Agwu just came in-system,\" Admiral Schmidt said. \"They've got casualties.\"\n\nMana'aktoo frowned. The idea of another force inflicting casualties on the Terran Space Force seemed almost impossible. \"Who attacked them?\"\n\n\"We should discuss this in private,\" Schmidt said. He looked at Mana'aktoo. \"This involves this system. As the Maktana and Carikan have made it plain they want you in charge, while you may be the Most High in Exile, you still wield enormous influence on the system.\"\n\n\"I will meet you in my office,\" Mana'aktoo said. He sent a quick datalink message to his manservant to meet the Admiral at the double-doors and escort the Terran and his two bodyguards to Mana'aktoo's office.\n\nSecond Most High Plu'umo'o, commander of the system's military forces and one of Mana'aktoo's co-conspirators, came trotting up.\n\n\"Go with the Admiral. There is a situation,\" Mana'aktoo ordered.\n\nThe Second Most High saluted, trotting after the Admiral.\n\nMana'aktoo went looking for the two people he wanted to include. Shonvlin, the Maktana leader, and Sheechilk, the Carikan leader. Both had been put forward by their respective species to act as liaisons to the Terran Space Force, which held the system under martial law.\n\nThe two leaders followed Mana'aktoo with no argument, quickly excusing themselves from the conversations they were holding.\n\nMana'aktoo arrived in his office to see the Space Force Admiral standing by the desk, apparently looking out the window, but Mana'aktoo could see the red telltales on the side of the Admiral's datalink.\n\nThe Admiral was quite busy.\n\nMana'aktoo trotted behind his desk, sitting down and waiting for the arm rests and back rest to swing into position. Once it had he waited, bringing up the holoterminal in the middle of the room.\n\nFinally the Admiral turned and faced everyone.\n\n\"Task Force Agwu was patrolling two of the systems nearby when they came under heavy attack by an overwhelming force of the new Precursor Autonomous War Machines,\" the Admiral said. \"They broke action twice, performing a fighting retreat.\"\n\nEveryone nodded. That was only logical, seeing as the Precursor AWM's were a fearsome opponent.\n\n\"Both times the clankers followed them, forcing them into action at the third location, which was between stellar masses,\" the Admiral said. He tossed up a hologram of the size of the Task Force.\n\nMana'aktoo didn't consider himself a military genius, but he had educated himself to the realities of the Terran military.\n\nEight carriers, twelve super-heavy warships, nearly a hundred attendant vessels, fifteen troop ships, two repair and refit ships.\n\nOne carrier was gone, two of the super-heavy, three of the troop ships, and sixteen of the attendant vessels.\n\n\"In return, Task Force Agwu managed to inflict serious casualties on the Precursors,\" The Admiral said.\n\nMana'aktoo looked at the numbers. For every Terran ship destroyed, they'd destroyed thirty-six point two two six of the Precursor ships.\n\n\"How many are expected to arrive?\" Mana'aktoo asked.\n\nThe Admiral nodded. \"They were heading this way already,\" the Admiral said. \"Task Force Agwu bought us a few days and are able to warn us of what would have been a significant ambush.\"\n\nMana'aktoo could feel Plu'umo'o's tension and underlying anxiety.\n\n\"How many of them are coming?\" Mana'aktoo asked.\n\nThe Admiral tossed the force makeup of the Precursors into the holotank in the middle of the room.\n\nMana'aktoo stared at the numbers. He nodded slowly, realizing what he was seeing. He turned to Plu'umo'o slowly.\n\n\"With the Terran's permission, recall the troops,\" he stated. \"Prepare the shelters, coordinate with Civil Defense.\"\n\n\"You have my permission to defend your world,\" the Admiral said. He stared at the holotank. \"Task Force Anvil is going to have its hands full.\"\n\n\"We will stop them here. They will go no further, and they will kill no more,\" Mana'aktoo said, staring at the numbers. \"We stand against them.\"\n\nHe turned and looked at the others.\n\n\"Together.\"\n\nIn the middle of the room the enemy force estimates burned in cold amber light.\n\nTwo thousand harvester class.\n\nIncoming.\n\nETA: Sixty-three hours.\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[First Appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/fwfknw/first_contact_second_wave_chapter_one_hundred/)\\] \\[[Last Appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/fy5hbu/first_contact_second_wave_chapter_one_hundred/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/jdxn6j/first_contact_chapter_333/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/jegw01/first_contact_chapter_335/)\\]",

In the medical world,  the full moon would be one of those. It doesn't actually hold true. \n\nBUT...\n\nThere is another superstition that DOES hold up. I've seen it too many times. Never utter the \"Q\" word inside a hospital, or unspeakable evil will befall.\n\nI had that demonstrated vividly to me back in the previous century. I had delivered someone to the ER at Parkland, the county hospital in Dallas. I'd never previously seen three empty beds in their ER at the same time. THAT day, I saw more than a dozen.  Without thinking, I said out loud \"Wow. It's really quiet here today.\" The charge nurse's head snapped around. He looked me right in the eyes and said \"You son of a bitch...\" And the bio-tel radio immediately chimed in to announce they had a mass casualty wreck on the freeway right before the exit for this same hospital, and currently had fourteen trauma cases inbound. That was one more than the current number of empty beds in the ER.",

He appeared to be on a holopad call, so I returned the gesture without saying a word. The Tilfish scientist was under a lot of scrutiny, after his leadership of the memory transcript project led to reviving me. There was additional pressure to extend the uploading capabilities beyond humans, though neuroscience from an Earth-based company was most advanced with our own kind. Legislators were keen to get involved, despite the fact that Austrian authorities and the UN had been apprised ahead of time. I intended to weigh in on that when the Sapient Coalition called, but securing aid for the war was a higher priority. Even synthetic bodies couldn't survive antimatter bombs; this endangered every being in our space.\n\n\u201cAs I was saying, there\u2019s been a vast uptick in the number of people participating in memory transcripts, ever since we announced Meier\u2019s success. It\u2019s insurance against death!\u201d Virnt gushed to the person on the other end of the phone. \u201cMore machines are getting installed\u2026some in public places. Everyone will be able to be reborn after death! It needs to be in every hospital, so we can scan anyone who passes through the doors or dies on the operating table.\u201d\n\nI turned to face Kuemper, as she slid into the back of the vehicle. \u201cIs that what you\u2019d want, if something happened to you now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. My specific consciousness would still end, granted, but a part of me would live on and get to see the future,\u201d she answered. \u201cI had a scan a few years ago. I plan to update my memories every so often, so they can restore me as I was.\u201d\n\nThe Tilfish continued jabbering into the line. \u201cElias has been quite successful. He is truly immortal so long as our servers and data survive! If something happens, we have his program exactly as it was\u2014it can be restored. I know he\u2019s had his struggles, but I\u2019m planning to swap out his eyes this week. It\u2019ll be no different than surgery; go to sleep, wake up with modifications.\u201d\n\nI hesitated to close the car door. \u201c*What* are you doing to my eyes?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanted eyelids, so I\u2019m going to give them to you. I\u2019ll tell you later! Anyhow, as I was saying, we\u2019re working to improve the sensory suites. Taste and smell are tricky. Proprioception, equilibrium, and motion detection are easier to fine-tune; they\u2019re a bit rudimentary now. Humans are complicated and have a thousand chain reactions to different environments. I\u2019d like Elias to test out things like\u2026swimming underwater, standing on one leg, or typing with his eyes closed once we give him eyelids.\u201d\n\n*I\u2019m learning new fears. I don\u2019t want to hear any more of this conversation.*\n\n\u201cStart the car,\u201d I grumbled, shutting the door. \u201cPlease. Covering my ears doesn\u2019t work that well, and he\u2019s talking pretty loud.\u201d\n\nVirnt\u2019s mandibles parted with delight, likely because he\u2019d been asked something about human senses. \u201cBalance comes from inner ear fluid, sloshing around; that\u2019s not so easy to replicate, so we\u2019re more applying the predicted stimuli that would occur *if* that fluid was there! However, you also rely on your eyes and body awareness. Humans are remarkable\u2014\u201d\n\nThe vehicle started off down the road, leaving the overexcited Tilfish behind. The car ride was a perfect showcase of just why my three senses needed fine-tuning; the sensation that I wasn\u2019t breathing escalated to levels of panic, while my \u201csuffocating\u201d body experienced waves of nausea. I *needed* to suck down oxygen to steady myself, to feel any of the input from my metal form as genuine. My limbs shook involuntarily, and I suddenly wished I walked down to Embassy Row, like I had during my visits to the Ulven and Racads. It hadn\u2019t been as bad in a spaceship with inertial dampeners, where I\u2019d had minimal view of my surroundings. Then again, I\u2019d been curled up in a ball for that trip.\n\nKuemper\u2019s eyebrows knitted together, before she placed a palm atop my hand to ground me. \u201cAfter Virnt announced all that to the world, I think I can figure out what\u2019s going on. Cars are no good?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, hating that I *could* feel sick to my non-existent stomach; it was phantom pain. The Secretary-General brought the car to a halt while I hugged the door, face pressed up to the window. The grating sensation that I was holding my breath was always present, but now, it felt like I was swallowing water by the bucketful. How could a car ride have sent my programming on such a cascade? The smallest, mundane experiences were now something I had to worry would set off my brain, and put me into a full state of panic from wrong signals. I wanted to apologize to Kuemper for creating such a scene, and pulling myself together for a few minutes.\u00a0\n\n*Virnt, I know you\u2019re reading this. Add this to your bug fix list\u2026pun intended.*\n\nThere\u2019d been zero ways to cope or find relief, in the thick of it. The general sensation of unwellness hung over me, along with a desperate desire to inhale through my nose. I found the strength to unhook the door\u2014I had to get out of this car, or it would be my second coffin. Perhaps I could walk off the episode in the punishing July heat. Back when I was a human, diplomatic attire was punishing in these months, with sweat drenching me from head to toe. Looking down at my shoes, I could see the pavement shimmering as it reflected the scalding sun. Nobody without a robotic body should be out in this weather, and I\u2019d meet Kuemper there. However, her car merely rolled alongside me, matching my pace.\n\n\u201cGo on without me,\u201d I offered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know the way to Embassy Row; I\u2019ll catch up.\u201d\n\nKuemper raised an unimpressed eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t know which one is the Leshee embassy, and there are 150-plus of them. I want to keep an eye on you anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk. I\u2019ll pick it up\u2026it\u2019s not like I can get tired. Hell, I won\u2019t be out of breath if we talk while I run.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never been in better shape. The best persistence predator this planet has ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a good point. Even death couldn\u2019t stop me.\u201d\n\nI started off at a light jog, not trusting my limbs not to do something zany. Gray-haired Elias hadn\u2019t been a marathon runner\u2014a contest I imagined our alien neighbors didn\u2019t enjoy watching\u2014but my present form could sprint without ceasing. There was no burning from lactic acid within muscles, only legs complying with the demands they were given. There were a multitude of stares and people recording, as they realized who I was; I supposed tearing down the streets of Vienna in July in a full suit-and-tie attracted attention. I found myself grinning at the absurdity. My pupils scanned to ensure I didn\u2019t run into anyone, not wholly trusting my depth perception.\u00a0\n\nThe amusement died down as we neared the diplomatic entrance to Embassy Row, and I spotted a memorial park situated just shy of it. My legs slowed just long enough to read the entrance plaque, head turning to face it. It had a list of names of all humans who died *outside*\u00a0of Earth during the Federation War, with several walls lined up within a cobblestone circle. That wasn\u2019t what had caught my notice out of my periphery. It was the bronze statue that I\u2019d registered, one with a face that I couldn't help but recognize. A cold feeling stirred within, gazing at a spitting replica of Elias Meier. They built\u2026*statues*\u00a0here to remember me.\u00a0\n\nHow did I even feel about that? *My name* was on the wall right alongside thousands of others, who hadn\u2019t gotten any second chance. I picked up the pace with new urgency, all too eager to get away from my likeness. Maybe this new body was just a thinking statue to Elias, the pacifist icon of the UN. There was no time to fall back into such thoughts, since I didn\u2019t want to cause our tardiness to the meeting. We were practically at the embassies, and from there, I could follow the Secretary-General\u2019s car to the Leshee\u2019s turf. Kuemper\u2019s motorcade bypassed the stringent security, with the checkpoint gates opened ahead of our arrival.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d zoned out as we wove to a domed building, where iridescent, frog-like beings waited for us. A gray blur appeared in my periphery, swooping down toward me; that proved enough to jolt me back to the present. Korajan had landed right next to us from the sky, gliding alongside me for a split second. Though I was startled at first, I managed to recover without flinching. The Secretary-General\u2019s motorcade proceeded ahead of me to the reception area, where Leshee staff waited to greet us. I walked a few paces behind with the Duerten ambassador, taking on a calm amble and straightening myself up. The avian parted his beak, eyes curious.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to ask for us to get you an audience in front of the Shield,\u201d Korajan stated as a fact. \u201cThat\u2019s what my UN contacts seemed to imply.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cWe were hoping you\u2019d help us.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo human has ever been allowed to visit during Shield meetings, Elias. Many feel that would be the beginning of us merging with the SC, rather than keeping an autonomous union. If I might be so frank, certain parties maintain communications with Earth because they see it as a necessity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what way? In case you need our assistance?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s rather impolite. You\u2019re the\u00a0 dominant power in our galactic neck of the woods, and they don\u2019t want to war with you. They\u2019d rather interact with the UN on some level, since it beats the perceived alternative. There would be great animosity toward an \u2018intrusion\u2019 in our halls.\u201d\n\nI clasped my hands behind my back. \u201cWhat do *you* think, Korajan? Why are you telling me this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you have proof now that the Sapient Coalition is threatened, and you believe you could rally us to your cause. My advice is not to look too far outside the Duerten Forum or the Leshee Junta. I do have great respect for humans, and I know *that* treatment hurts you more than you let on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve faced worse. I\u2019m curious, Korajan, how you became an ambassador on Earth. Did you always have such favorable views of humans?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Duerten admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the patterns in your social dynamics and customs over time. Originally, I was half-hoping the worst commentary about you was true. A part of me *wished*\u00a0you would rip me to shreds or lose control while I was alone on your world. I wanted a human to swallow me whole before my grief did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so unspeakably sorry. It\u2019s my sincere hope that your mental state has changed for the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt most certainly has. Honestly, what helped me most was visiting a live music bar, and listening to songs a local band wrote about Earth\u2019s bombing. It reminded me of\u2026a lot of things. They started to recognize me, and I understood their pain so intrinsically, Elias. I started playing the tambourine just so I could join their jam sessions. Even learned enough English to songwrite a little with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that you found the right people, Korajan. If you ever feel inclined to share your songs with me, I\u2019d be honored.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I will. It might be unbecoming of an ambassador, but I\u2019m offering all of this in the spirit of friendship. I\u2019ll still help you, whatever you decide. Just be aware of what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d\n\nThe two of us fell in alongside Kuemper, who was exchanging pleasantries with Leshee Ambassador Yali. The amphibian looked a bit uncomfortable by my presence, which I found understandable; it wasn\u2019t discrimination over my species, but my unique circumstances. I wondered about how long I\u2019d be the sole revived brain scan. It was unfortunate to have nobody to talk to that was going through the same thing, as was often the therapeutic practice for other traumatic events. Then again, I didn\u2019t want to bring anyone else back to this reality until Virnt had ironed out the flaws. My self-awareness heightened as I saw a Terran metal detector in the entrance, and hung back\u2014knowing full well I\u2019d trip it.\n\n\u201cMaybe I should stay here,\u201d I whispered to Kuemper. \u201cAre you okay with Virnt reading\u2026sensitive state discussions? He has access to everything I see.\u201d\n\nThe Secretary-General snorted. \u201cThat Tilfish has our top clearance level. He has to, with the important figures he\u2019s done memory scans on. Not to mention he\u2019s worked with the military and Project Chronicle.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. Give me a moment to, ah, collect my bearings.\u201d\n\nKorajan hopped through the detector, beckoning to me. \u201cElias is going to set off the security alarms, Ambassador Yali. You know, I shudder to think that resurrected Duerten might not be able to fly. I mean, we need light bones, and metal is quite the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens if a metal predator goes on a rampage? He\u2019s unkillable,\u201d Yali whispered to the Duerten, soft gums showing in her mouth.\n\n*I don\u2019t think the Leshee meant for me to hear that, but I suppose the exterminators wouldn\u2019t have much impact on me.*\n\nFumbling for a way to reassure the amphibian, I strolled through the checkpoint, setting off a series of alarms. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem a pleasant way to start a diplomatic meeting, weighing whether we can kill each other. I have always been an advocate of peace, and spent my tenure *avoiding* unnecessary bloodshed. We\u2019re here in the hopes of banding together against a novel threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United Nations recognizes how vital the Leshee are to the Shield. We hope to not only offer a warning, but to find a path forward that keeps civilians out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d Kuemper chimed in.\n\nYali hopped toward a seating area, eyes filled with anxiety. \u201cI\u2019ll hear what you have to say, but I would appreciate if we could keep this brief. I\u2019m not accustomed\u00a0to *this* type of human, Madam Secretary-General.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to recuse myself if it\u2019d put your mind at ease,\u201d I responded. \u201cBelieve me, Ambassador, I\u2019m not used to this type of human either, yet I have to live in this body. Perhaps I belong on the sidelines, though I assure you, my only intent was to gather allies. Until I stay dead, I\u2019ll never stop trying to find new friends for humanity, and achieve the harmonious future I\u2019ve always dreamed of.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Leshee are your friends, Mr. Elias Meier. We have helped you before in the hopes that you\u2019d show up, if we ever needed it. However, my government is beginning to feel this is a bit one-sided. You seek aid often, without anything given in return.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you seek monetary or material recompense, we can arrange that,\u201d Kuemper stated. \u201cHowever, we always considered our relations to be a mutual alliance.\u201d\n\nKorajan parted his beak. \u201cThe Duerten will not keep score, as we are forever in debt to Earth and her people. Humanity saved Kalqua, Yali, and they\u2019d help you. Consider it fortunate your planet was not subjected to an orbital barrage.\u201d\n\nSympathy glistened in the Leshee\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe would never wish such a thing upon ourselves. My words are merely reflecting the uneven nature of our present arrangement, should the humans wish to call on us for a favor again.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive me, but have you ever *asked*\u00a0anything of us?\u201d I chimed in. \u201cIf the roles were reversed, and you came to us for ten favors in a row, we wouldn\u2019t be settling a ledger. We would extend a helping hand out of our goodwill and generosity. That is the definition of a friend: someone who is there no matter what, when you need them most.\u201d\n\nKuemper cleared her throat. \u201cWe aren\u2019t here for ourselves, and even the times we have been, it\u2019s to save lives. We care for our citizens, and will always step in to resolve issues outside of Earth. I find it unfortunate that humans in Shield space are imperiled to this day, though we are grateful for any and all assistance the Leshee have given.\u201d\n\n\u201cA question, if you\u2019ll humor a \u2018metal predator.\u2019 For all the talk of our inherent violence and *rampages,* how many times have you needed to approach us regarding any of your people on Earth?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce,\u201d Yali replied, lowering her head. \u201cThere\u2019d been a train accident, it turned out. Human rescue workers dug a little girl out of the rubble, resuscitated her twice\u2026refusing to give up on saving her. The surgeons operated on her for hours, showing no appetite for her insides or the blood aromas swirling around them\u2014only deep-rooted concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps such a story could buy us a bit more goodwill, my friend. It\u2019s proof that we give to anyone in need, and seek nothing for it.\u201d\n\nKorajan fluttered his wings. \u201cI can attest to their kindness. I\u2019ve witnessed it. Their involvement in this disaster started to help the Sivkits, a party outside their organization, who\u2019d turned away from us all for decades. Humanity heeded the call regardless.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, they\u2019ve entered our space. Three massive drone contingents, on separate vectors, were detected on a stealthy route into the heart of our territory,\u201d Erin Kuemper added. \u201cWe don\u2019t know their destination, but we suspect Nishtal is a likely target. Help us protect the homeworld we just now rebuilt. The Shield knows what an arduous process that was.\u201d\n\nI nodded my head, turning my eyes toward the friendly Duerten. \u201cI\u2019ve absolutely heard what Korajan expressed, about risking your own assets on account of the Sapient Coalition. That takes tremendous nobility and courage. However, even the slightest contributions could make a difference. Count the fingers I have on a hand\u2014that\u2019s all the ships it would\u2019ve taken to stop one bomber that hit Kalqua or Earth. That\u2019s all it takes to save millions of lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you put it like that\u2026I\u2019ll see if we can spare a small number. Every ship does make a difference,\u201d the avian ambassador murmured.\u00a0\n\nThere was a brief spell of hesitation, as the Leshee ambassador pondered our words. Her species and ours shared the common link of being judged for biological requirements, as their tadpoles required water to survive. Since the Kolshians viewed that as a vector for disease, the amphibians were ostracized and considered unclean. They\u2019d grown their influence as the Shield\u2019s numbers grew, though they still clung to old Federation rhetoric\u2014like most species in their organization. I hoped that they could put aside the dogma long enough to act for the common good.\n\n\u201cWhile the Krakotl have become dietarily contemptible\u2026like many Coalition members, after being around you\u2026I will recommend that my government intercedes on Nishtal\u2019s behalf,\u201d Yali decided. \u201cNow if that\u2019s all\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThe words tumbled from my mouth, reaching a snap decision after recalling my conversation with Korajan. I shifted my eyes back and forth between the Duerten and the Secretary-General, searching for approval. My old friend\u2014a former SETI scientist having reached the top echelons of the UN\u2014gave me a nod. While it would make a fractional difference to acquire any manner of aid, we couldn\u2019t set our aim that low. My goal heading into this was to knock on every door I could, and Korajan\u2019s warning only convinced me that galactic change was still a necessity. The Shield fearing us wasn\u2019t something that we wanted; they weren\u2019t our enemies, and it was high time their members realized that fully.\u00a0\n\nIf Noah had risked his literal head with a hostile audience, it fell on my shoulders to do the same. I was a diplomat that wasn\u2019t in physical jeopardy, and like Virnt gushed on his call, my \u201cprogram\u201d could be restored in the worst case scenario. Someone had to start down the path of warming the Shield, as an entity, toward our cause.\n\n\u201cI would like to visit the Shield,\u201d I stated with confidence. \u201cI know the Leshee have the sway to arrange such a meeting. I\u2019m well aware that you haven\u2019t invited a human within your halls, since your formation. However, if you invite me, that will remain true. Any metal detector can tell you I\u2019m not human.\u201d\n\nYali seemed dumbfounded. \u201cThen what are\u00a0you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked that same question when I woke in a lab, Ambassador. You know that I\u2019m something beyond predator or prey\u2026that we\u2019re *all*\u00a0moving toward something far outside the animal kingdom. Instead of worrying whether I\u2019m unkillable, the Shield should be asking whether you could be too. You don\u2019t want a golden age of progress to pass you by. You don\u2019t want it not to come about at all because a war took us down.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpening your doors could strengthen technological trade between our forums,\u201d Kuemper tacked on. \u201cIf we can work together during wartime, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t better each other outside of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that why Elias came? You\u2019re dangling your new discovery in front of us?\u201d the Leshee ambassador asked. \u201cI don\u2019t see what we have to gain, aside from this elusive promise, by bringing you into our midst. I don\u2019t see what *you* have to gain.\u201d\n\nI smiled, nostalgia flickering in my mind. \u201cGood things happen when humanity reaches out. We entered a Federation meeting, and convinced dozens to abide our existence; we owe our survival to that. There was also a tiny portion that chose to befriend us because of our plea. I wish to speak a few words, and if one party warms to us for it, I\u2019ll consider it worthwhile. We only *ever* reached out to the stars in search of friends, Ambassadors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI searched tirelessly in the hopes that we weren\u2019t alone,\u201d Kuemper agreed. \u201cWe want to share the universe with others. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find that to be a beautiful notion,\u201d Korajan interjected. \u201cThere have been a vast many positives that came from humanity\u2019s survival and networking. We only know who we truly are because of them. The Leshee aren\u2019t judged by your peers for your aquatic aptitudes, either.\u201d\n\nI gave the Duerten a nod of gratitude. \u201cWe have never once tried to force you to merge with us, or engage against your wishes. The Shield exists as a free entity today because our ambassador spoke at a meeting for a few minutes, twenty-four years ago. What could it hurt to give us the same opportunity today, and see what might come of it?\u201d\n\nAfter another lengthy pause, one where the tension gnawed at my mind, Yali heaved a flustered sigh. \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll approach my superiors about this, and tell them what you\u2019ve said. Our embassy will be in contact if they grant you an audience. Please, leave now\u2026before I change my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. I\u2019m deeply appreciative that you\u2019ve heard our case, and have been receptive to our words. We won\u2019t trouble you any longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave a pleasant rest of your afternoon, Ambassador Yali,\u201d Kuemper said, rising to her feet. \u201cThese will be historic steps toward a bright, prosperous future. I look forward to improving the dialogues between our species. My thanks as well to Ambassador Korajan for his supportive presence.\u201d\n\nThe Duerten squawked in amusement. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me for speaking the truth. It\u2019s a simple gesture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked simple gestures.\u201d\n\nI felt a bit less off-putting and out of place upon our departure. With a solid chance at receiving an invitation to the Shield\u2019s place of governance, I thought that the Leshee meeting had been a sweeping success. Flexing my diplomatic muscles paid dividends today, suggesting cyborg Meier still had enough charisma to stay in the game. In the spirit of optimism, it was time to plan just how I\u2019d tackle my visit to the Shield.\u00a0\n\n---\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/195q9rx/the_nature_of_predators_21/)\u00a0|\u00a0[Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1d0d8dx/the_nature_of_predators_239/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1d5opdw/the_nature_of_predators_241/)\n\n[Star Crossed \\[Multiple Free Sample Chapters\\]](https://www.patreon.com/posts/100228083?utm_campaign=postshare_creator)\u00a0|\u00a0[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/spacepaladin15)\u00a0|\u00a0[Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/)\u00a0|\u00a0[Discord](https://discord.gg/Dqj4HkRdpw)\u00a0|\u00a0[Paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ5QNWBV)\u00a0|\u00a0[NOP2 Species Lore](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/s/G4hG1VS5wa)",

Conjunctions of thousands of claims are less likely than single claims. So again this makes Islam extremely low probability before you\u00a0*even start*\u00a0the analysis.\n\nNow let\u2019s get into it.\n\n**1)\u00a0 The Inheritance Problem**\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a mathematical error in the Quran. It directly instructs you to do a mathematical thing that\u2019s impossible. (Surah An-Nisa 4:11-12)\n\nIf you die and have two daughters, two parents, and a wife, you literally cannot divide up the estate the way the Quran commands.\n\nIt\u2019s not plausible that God would make a simple math mistake.\n\n(The fact that the Shia and Sunni disagree on how to interpret the inheritance verses proves that it\u2019s not obvious from the text how you should handle this error.)\n\n**2)\u00a0 Scientific Errors**\u00a0\n\n* Stars/meteors are lamps used to pelt devils \u2014\u00a0*Surah Al-Mulk 67:5*\n* Babies come from an an \\*ejected\\* fluid between the backbone and ribs \u2014\u00a0*Surah At-Tariq 86:6\u20137*\n* The Earth can talk \u2014\u00a0*Surah Fussilat 41:11\u00a0 /\u00a0 Az-Zalzalah 99:4*\n* Ants can talk and have human concepts \u2014\u00a0*Surah An-Naml 27:18\u201319*\n* The Quran describes lightning praising God.\u00a0\u00a0*Surah Ar-Ra\u2019d 13:13 (Why do humans require years of education to learn to speak and think but lightning*\u00a0requires\u00a0*a second?)*\n* Mountains are like pegs to stabilize the Earth that\u2019s flattened like a bed \u2014\u00a0*Surah An-Naba 78:6\u20137 and\u00a0 Surah An-Nahl\u00a0 16:15*\n* Bones form first, then get clothed in muscle (rather than forming in parallel) \u2014\u00a0*Surah al-Mu\u02bemin\u016bn 23:12\u201314*\n* A flock of birds destroyed an army of elephants by dropping clay stones on them \u2014\u00a0*Surah al-Fil, 105:1\u20135*.

But other domesticated species like llamas, alpacas, and reindeer existed long before Islam.\u00a0\n* The Quran describes God having a literal physical throne.\u00a0\u00a0*Surah Ghafir 40:7 (Why does an immaterial being need this?)*\u00a0\n* The Quran describes there being seven heavens or skies.\u00a0\u00a0*Surah al-Mulk 67:3*\n* The Quran describes the sky as a roof. \u2014 Surah Al-Anbiya 21:32\n* The Earth is described in ways that suggest flatness: Surah An-Naba 78:6\n\nThese are\u00a0*clearly*\u00a0the views of an uneducated pre-scientific person.\n\n**3)\u00a0 Many Reliable Hadiths are Comical**  \nMany literalist Muslims treat the Sahih hadiths\u2014especially those in Bukhari and Muslim\u2014as effectively infallible or nearly so, believing them to be highly reliable and authoritative sources of religious guidance, second only to the Quran\n\n* Dates (the fruit) make you not affected from magic or poison \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 5445*\n* If a fly lands in your drink, dip it fully because one wing has poison and the other the cure \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 3320*\n* Whoever orgasms first determines the baby\u2019s sex \u2014\u00a0*Sahih Muslim 315a*\u00a0/\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 3329*\n* Adam was \\~90 feet tall and humanity has been shrinking since \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 3326*\n* Trees can talk and are racist \u2014\u00a0*Sahih Muslim 2922a*\n* Drinking camel urine is good medicine \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 5686*\u00a0\n* Some rats are transformed Jews and you can tell because they follow kosher diets \u2013\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 3305*\n* Angels avoid houses with dogs \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 3322*\n* Satan sleeps in your nose and ties your hair into knots when you are sleeping \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 1142 / Sahih al-Bukhari 3295*\n* Most people in Hell are women and their intelligence is deficient \u2013\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 304*\u00a0(Which is funny because most rape and murder is commited by men.)\n* Monkeys stone other monkeys for adultery. -\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 3849*\n* \u00a0Satan farts when the call to prayer happens because he is running away so quickly. -\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 608*\n* Drink sitting down, if you drink while standing then puke it up. \u2014\u00a0*Sahih Muslim 2026*\n* \u00a0Both of God\u2019s hands are right hands \u2014\u00a0*Sunan an-Nasa'i 5379*\n* You should wipe your butt with odd numbers of stones. \u2014\u00a0*Sahih Muslim 239*\n* It\u2019s good to kill dogs, especially black dogs which are devils. \u2014\u00a0*Sahih Muslim 1572 / Sahih Muslim 510a*\n* If a wife turns down sex, angels will curse her until morning \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari*\u00a05193\u00a0\n* Angels hate onions \u2014\u00a0*Sahih muslim 564a*\u00a0\u00a0\n* Angels cause thunder \u2014\u00a0*Jami\\` at-Tirmidhi 3117*\n* You should kill lizards \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 3359 / Sahih Muslim 2238*\u00a0(He blames all lizards for the crimes of some lizards which is racist.)\n* There are seven Earths that you can fall into. \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 2454*\u00a0\u00a0\n* If Jews did not exist, meat would not decay \u2014\u00a0*Sahih al-Bukhari 3399*\n* A literal rock/stone can steal clothing and run away \u2014*Sahih al-Bukhari 3404*\n* Do not eat with your left hand, because Satan eats with his left hand. \u2014\u00a0*Sahih Muslim 2019*\u00a0 (If Satan doing stuff means you shouldn\u2019t do it, it implies that you shouldn\u2019t talk, sleep, run, laugh etc.)\u00a0\n* \u00a0Don\u2019t lie on your back with feet on top of each other.\u00a0*\u2014*\u00a0*Sahih Muslim 2099e*\n* Black seed (Nigella sativa) cures every disease except death\u00a0*\u2014\u00a0 Sahih al-Bukhari 7:591*\n* Don\u2019t wipe your butt with camel poop.\u00a0*\u2014 Sahih Muslim 263 (Why does this need to be said?)*\n* The Sun prostrates under God's throne after it sets.\u00a0*\u2014 Sahih al-Bukhari 4802*\n* Tailbones don\u2019t decay.\u00a0*\u2014 Sahih Muslim 2955a*\n* Backgammon is evil.\u00a0*\u2014*\u00a0\u00a0*Sunan Ibn Majah 3763*\u00a0\n* Talking wolves exist and are into Islam.\u00a0*-\u00a0 Musnad Ahmad 11792.*\n* Pus is better than poetry. \u2014 Sahih al-Bukhari 6154\n* Muslims are at war with all snakes (some of which are jinns)*. \u2014 Sunan Abu Dawud 5250, Al-Tabarani, Al-Mujam al-Kabir 11946*\n\nIf you think these are metaphors, what is drinking camel piss a good metaphor for?\n\n**4)**\u00a0\u00a0**There are Literal Contradictions**\u00a0\n\nWhich was made first, the Earth or the Heavens?\n\n* Option 1 \u2013 Earth first: Earth created, then mountains, then heavens \u2014 Surah Fussilat 41:9\u201312 / 2:29\n* Option 2 \u2013 Heavens first: Heavens built, then Earth spread \u2014 Surah An-Nazi\u2019at 79:27\u201330\n\nIs Hell forever?\n\n* Option 1 \u2013 Proportional punishment: \u201cWhoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except with the like thereof...\u201d \u2014 Surah Ghafir 40:40\n* Option 2 \u2013 Eternal punishment: \"Abiding eternally therein.

The question isn\u2019t whether apologetics exist\u2014it\u2019s whether they\u2019re persuasive and plausible.\n\n**5)\u00a0 A Perfect Book Wouldn\u2019t be this Ambiguous**  \n\u201c*These are the verses of the clear Book*.\u201d\u00a0*(Surah Ash-Shu\u2018ara\u00a0 26:2)*\n\nSometimes the Quran says \u201c*God is light*\u201d (Surah An-Nur 24:35), sometimes that \u201c*the Earth talked*\u201d (Surah Fussilat 41:11). Sometimes it says there are \u201c*locks on people\u2019s hearts*.\u201d (Surah Muhammad 47:24) There\u2019s no clear note about whether these are metaphorical or literal. It would have been\u00a0*trivial*\u00a0to clear up such ambiguities. How can a literally perfect book not be clear?\n\nIf there is a miscommunication between two people, the fault is on\u00a0*both people*\u00a0unless the speaker is maximally clear or the listener was maximally perceptive. It would have been trivial to make the Quran clearer so it isn\u2019t maximally clear. So it\u2019s not perfect.\n\n*There should be no ambiguity on whether beating your wife or aggressive holy war are allowed.*\u00a0Obviously.\n\nScholars have spent centuries debating what many verses mean without reaching consensus. If even the scholarly and faithful can\u2019t agree after centuries of debate, it could have been written more clearly. And if it could have been written more clearly, it\u2019s not perfect.\n\nAlso, major Islamic schools (e.g., Hanafi vs. Hanbali) do not agree how to handle unmentioned things. Which is a pretty big deal! Something that could have easily been cleared up by a single line.\n\nThe Quran also admits that some verses are unclear: Quran 3:7 \u201csome verses are precise\u2026 while others are ambiguous.\u201d Why not make all verses\u00a0*clear*? The Quran (16:89) also says, \u201cWe have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance.\u201c Which leads to a contradiction.\n\n.**6)\u00a0 Obviously**\u00a0\n\nYou obviously shouldn't believe a guy who tells you that God said he's allowed to have more wives than you.\n\n**7)\u00a0 Petty Vindictiveness**\u00a0\n\nRoughly 10 percent of verses in the Quran insult or threaten non-believers. I am not making that up. 10 percent. They\u2019re called fools, blind, arrogant, or are told they\u2019ll burn in hell. Oh, you think a perfectly wise and intelligent being is going to spend 10 percent of his holy text, his last testament to man, talking crap to the haters?\n\n*Why not persuade the unbelievers rather than threaten and insult them?*\u00a0\n\n**8)\u00a0 Abrogation**\n\nAccording to most Muslim scholars, later verses cancel earlier ones.\u00a0*Why would God not plan out his verses better so that you didn't need a principle of abrogation?*\n\n1. Surah Qaf 50:29 says, \u201cMy Word cannot be changed.\u201d \n2. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:106 says, \u201cIf We ever abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We replace it with a better or similar one.\u201d\n\n*How can both of these both be true?*\n\nAlso, if abrogations exist, why was the Quran dynamically changing in the 20ish years of Muhammad\u2019s preaching, but no dynamic changes were needed in the roughly 1400 years since Muhammad\u2019s life?\u00a0\n\n**9)\u00a0 Missing Guidance**\u00a0\n\nThe Quran has three different verses on alcohol. But it has nothing on artificial intelligence, cloning, nuclear war, social media, germs/washing hands before surgery, environmental damage/climate change, vaccines, teleportation, transhumanism, aliens, mind uploading, robots, bioweapons, or exploring other planets.\n\nWhy is liquor more important than those? Why would God not want to give us ethical and prudential advice on issues more complicated and consequential than liquor?\n\nWhy give\u00a0*three verses*\u00a0on alcohol, but none on these?\n\n**10)\u00a0 Why Not Trivially Prove Itself From God**\u00a0\n\nGod could have proven divine authorship easily.\n\nGod could have listed the next 10,000 visible-from-Earth supernovas with their exact dates and coordinates. Why didn't God do something that would make it obvious that the Quran is not made by a human?\u00a0**The Quran contains no information a human at that time couldn't have known or guessed which is super suspicious**. Like even just including an accurate description of Australia or South America would be eyebrow raising. Or mentioning dinosaurs or kangaroos.\n\nThe Quran says, \u201cHe makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.\u201d (Ar-R\u2019ad 13:2) Yet he didn\u2019t make it certain when he trivially could have.\n\n**11)\u00a0 Occam\u2019s Razor**\u00a0\n\nOccam\u2019s razor is brutal to religious texts. To believe the Quran is divine, you have to jointly accept thousands of distinct claims. (Any of which could be wrong.) It's a really complicated hypothesis. Just think about probability: A and B and C and D all happening is going to be less likely than just A happening.\u00a0\n\nSuppose each verse has a .999 percent chance of being true:\n\n* Multiplying .999 times itself 6236 times 0.00194\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n* Multiplying .9999 times itself 6236 times is\u00a0 0.5357\u00a0\n\nAnalogously, even if each item in the phone book has an extremely high probability of being correct when you have thousands of items in the phonebook it becomes likely that there\u2019s a mistake somewhere.\u00a0\n\nNow, suppose you doubt this above iterated multiplication procedure, you should still accept that the more complicated the hypothesis, the lower the prior probability. For example, it\u2019s obvious that \u201cGod exists\u201d is, a priori, more likely than \u201cGod exists and is named Bob and likes playing bananagrams on Thursdays and likes the smell of goose eggs and likes vacationing in Cuba.\u201d\n\nAnd ignoring all these subtle points about parsimony and probability, what\u2019s more likely without any other info? A guy made up a story, or God wrote this specific book with these thousands of claims and there are no errors in it?\n\n**12)\u00a0 Splitting the Moon**\u00a0\n\nThe Quran says Muhammad split the moon, but no one outside Arabia noticed this? No one in China or Byzantium wrote this down?\n\n**13)\u00a0 Fitna**\u00a0\n\nThere were two civil wars immediately after Muhammad\u2019s death. (Ridda Wars/Fitna) If Muhammad truly gave divine guidance, why did it immediately lead to bloodshed? I'd sort of expect peace and love to be the result of divine revelation.\n\n(I also wouldn\u2019t expect the Islamic slave trade and the conquest of Byzantium and the Sassanids. Nor would I expect the general poverty in Islamic countries today.)\n\n**14)\u00a0 Dhul-Qarnayn**\u00a0\n\nThis character in the Quran Dhul-Qarnayn matches Alexander the Great myths that were floating around Arabia at the time (e.g., the Syriac Alexander Legend). If the Dhul-Qarnayn story were the real history of Alexander, you\u2019d expect it to match earlier, more accurate Alexander writings. But it in fact aligns with later fantastical Alexander stories. When have legends gotten more accurate over time?\u00a0\n\nAlso, the Quranic passages containing Dhul-Qarnayn also claim Gog and Magog and their people are blocked behind a wall between two mountains until the end of time. Where are they? Why haven\u2019t we found them? You think humans would have found a giant gate between mountains enclosing an army.\n\n**15)\u00a0 Don\u2019t Show Up Early For Dinner**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDo you really think a perfect, infinitely intelligent timeless God would take up valuable space in his final holy book to say, \"Hey, don\u2019t show up early to the Prophet\u2019s house for dinner\"? (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:53)\n\nIsn't believing this kind of ridiculous? Don\u2019t you think that within the limited space of the Quran, there was a more important point to make than that?\n\n**16)\u00a0 Hell**\u00a0\n\nThere is a strong tension between these two verses:\u00a0\n\n* \u201cWe will cast them into the Fire. Whenever their skin is burnt completely, We will replace it so they will \u02f9constantly\u02fa taste the punishment.\u201d (Surah An-Nisa 4:56)\n\nand\n\n* \u201cDo not lose hope in Allah\u2019s mercy, for Allah certainly forgives all sins. He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\u201d (Surah Az-Zumar\u00a0 39:53)\n\nWhy would the most merciful being torture someone like this for an eternity? Like you are saying after a quadrillion years of torture they haven\u2019t had enough? They need another quadrillion years? And this is merciful? People who say this are just not imagining what a quadrillion years of torture actually is.\n\nIt\u2019s just childish to call someone who tortures someone for quadrillions of years a merciful being.\n\n**17)\u00a0 The Quran Gives a Falsifiability Test\u2014and Fails It**\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd if you are in doubt\u2026 produce a surah like it\u2026\u201d (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23)\n\nShortest surah is:\n\n*\u201cWe have granted you al-Kawthar. So pray and sacrifice. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off.\u201d*\n\nThis is not some unbeatable literary miracle. It\u2019s not hard to write something more profound. Compare it to this fake\u00a0 Surah I invented.\n\nSurah al-Fala\u1e25 (The Flourishing)\n\n*Verily, do not kill, for life is sacred in the sight of the Most High.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not steal, for the provision of your Lord is sufficient for those who walk upright.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not rape, for the body is a trust, and to violate it is a crime before the heavens.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not torture, for your Lord is the Most Merciful, and loves not the oppressors.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not enslave for freedom is beloved in the mind of Most Righteous.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not lie, for falsehood is the path of ruin, and truth is the light upon the straight path.*\u00a0\n\n*And love your fellow man, and strive to bring flourishing to the earth,*\n\n*For your Lord made you stewards, not tyrants, and blessed are those who sow peace and righteousness.*  \n\u00a0\n\nBut at the end of the day, evaluating which text is \u2018better\u2019 is a subjective, non-truth-apt exercise. If the Quran stakes its truth on that kind of subjective test, the test is ill-posed\u2014and that, by itself, makes God look like a moron.\u00a0\n\n**18)\u00a0 The Satanic Verses Incident**\u00a0\n\nEarly Islamic sources (al-Tabari, Ibn Ishaq) record Muhammad delivering verses praising pagan gods (All\u0101t, Al-Uzza, and Man\u0101t) \u2014 then retracting the verses claiming they were Satanic deception.\n\nIf Satan could trick Muhammad once, why assume he didn\u2019t succeed more often? It proves that Muhammad is fallible, and can be tricked about what is from God and what is not from God.\n\nI know some modern Muslims want to deny this event happened, but earlier Muslims thought it happened, and\u00a0*why would you know better than them*?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**19)\u00a0 Hadiths are an Unreliable Method**\u00a0\n\nIn Islam, many Muslims say the hadiths are necessary for interpreting the Quran. Why is God using an unreliable method\u2014a game of Chinese whispers\u2014to give you mandatory information for how to practice the faith? If it\u2019s mandatory for the faith, why not just put it into the Quran itself?\n\nIf God wanted to guide people clearly and unambiguously, why not stick to a single, safeguarded text? Why allow a bunch of opaque oral reports to become central to the religion, despite obvious risks of error and confusion.\n\nIf hadith scholars who graded the reliability of hadiths are fallible, the whole system based on this is fallible.\n\n**20)\u00a0 Inside View vs Outside View**\u00a0\n\nFrom the inside view, your religion might feel incredibly compelling\u2014emotionally resonant, logically sound, or simply self-evident. This personal perspective provides powerful subjective evidence.\n\nBut from the outside view, however, billions throughout history have felt equally certain about other rival contradictory beliefs. Religious adherents cannot all be correct despite similar confidence levels.\n\nJust as a startup founder must balance internal optimism with the reality that 70% of startups fail, religious believers should weigh their personal confidence against the broader pattern of billions of religious people being wrong despite their similar certainty through history.\n\nHumans are very capable of\u00a0**incorrectly, confidently**\u00a0thinking they have sacred text from God. And\u00a0*you know humans are like this*. You could be the kind of person that mistakenly thinks your holy text is right given that you know people do this all the time.\u00a0\n\n**21)\u00a0 Morally Problematic Teachings**\u00a0\n\n* The Quran permits wife-beating as a final step to discipline disobedient wives.\u00a0*(Surah An-Nisa 4:34)*\n* The Quran permits sex with female slaves\u2014without their consent or marriage.\u00a0*(Surah Al-Mu\u2019minun 23:5\u20136; An-Nisa 4:24; Al-Ahzab 33:50)*\n* The Quran prescribes cutting off the hands of thieves.\u00a0*(Surah Al-Ma\u2019idah 5:38)*\n* The Quran recommends crucifixion and cutting off hands and feet on opposite sides for rebels.\u00a0*(Surah Al-Ma\u2019idah 5:33)*\n* The Quran commands Muslims to kill polytheists wherever they find them.\u00a0*(Surah At-Tawbah 9:5) (Why not include a sunset clause if this is temporary.)*\n* The Quran says a woman\u2019s testimony is worth half a man\u2019s in financial matters.\u00a0*(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:282)*\n* The Quran allows marriage and divorce of girls who haven\u2019t yet menstruated.\u00a0*(Surah At-Talaq 65:4)*\n* The Quran endorses a story where a boy is killed\u2014**not**\u00a0for anything he did, but because he would have sinned in the future.\u00a0*(Surah Al-Kahf 18:80)*\n* The Quran shames people for being bastards\u00a0*(Surah Al-Qalam 68:13)*\n\nEven the \u201cnice\u201d lines can collapse into cruelty  \nThe Quran\u2019s famous kind slogan \u2014\u00a0*\u201cWhoever kills a soul, it is as if he killed all mankind\u201d*\u00a0(5:32) \u2014 is immediately followed by 5:33 prescribing crucifixion and maiming. The book seemingly can\u2019t even let its most quoted \u201cpeaceful\u201d verse breathe without pivoting straight back to brutality.\n\nSort of surprising God would endorse or recommend things so vicious.\n\nAlso,\u00a0**obviously**\u00a0any sacred text that doesn't explicitly ban slavery is not plausibly from God.\u00a0\n\n**22)\u00a0 Muhammad\u2019s Character isn\u2019t Plausibly Divinely Guided**\u00a0\n\nHe had sex with a 9-year-old (*Aisha*), owned a sex slave (*Maria the Copt*), married a woman right after killing her husband (*Safiyya bint Huyayy*), initiated aggressive military actions (*Khaybar*), owned slaves (*Sahih Muslim 115*), and traded two black slaves for one Arab slave (Sahih Muslim 1602a). He stopped visiting his second wife because she was too old and visited Aisha instead (*Saudah bint Zam\u02bfah*). He tongue kissed a young boy (*Hakim 4791 and Mufrad 1183*). Muhammad said to a girl she shouldn't have freed her slavegirl and that she should have given the slavegirl to her uncle. (*Sahih al-Bukhari 2592*) He married his step-daughter and arguably ended the practice of adoption merely so he could do that. (Zaynab) He declared the person who\u00a0*stabbed to death*\u00a0a woman, who disparaged him, shouldn't be punished. (*Sunan Abi Dawud 4361*) Muhammad attacked the Quraysh caravan at Nakhlah during the sacred month of Rajab, which shattered the pan-Arab taboo against warfare in a holy month.\u00a0 Muhammad endorsed the execution of all pubescent males of the Banu Qurayza tribe and the enslavement of the women and children. Finally, Muhammad didn\u2019t set up a stable succession system which led to awful turmoil.\n\n**23)\u00a0 The Scribe who Caught Muhammad Copying Him**\u00a0\n\n\u201c*If Muhammad is truthful then I receive the revelation as much as he does*.\u201d - \u02bfAbdullah ibn Sa\u02bfd\n\nOne of Muhammad\u2019s scribes, \u02bfAbdullah ibn Sa\u02bfd, left Islam after realizing Muhammad repeated his phrasings of verses as revelation (*Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah; al-Tabari, Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk*). In at least one case, after the scribe added a flourish like \u201cSo blessed be Allah, the best of creators!\u201d, Muhammad reportedly agreed and said it should be part of the verse.\n\n\u02bfAbdullah ibn Sa\u02bfd thought: \u201cWait, this isn\u2019t divine, I said that\u2014he\u2019s just going with whatever sounds good.\u201d He also messed around with word orderings to see if Muhammad would notice.\n\nHe left, told people, and Muhammad ordered him killed and he was only pardoned because he was family with one of Muhammad's close companions, Uthman.\n\n**24)\u00a0 The Injustice of Geography**  \nWhy did Arabs get this blessing of divine knowledge? Why didn\u2019t God send a Muhammad type prophet to the Cambodians, Nigerians, Dutch, and Apache? Why did they have to wait hundreds of years to receive God\u2019s blessing of the Quran? Isn\u2019t that unfair? This fact of the Quran showing up once in Arabia makes total sense if Muhammad made up the book. It makes less sense if God wanted to give all of humanity his divine instruction.\u00a0\n\nAlso, most people stay in the religion they\u2019re raised in. Yet under traditional Islam, salvation depends on accepting Islam\u2014meaning a Hindu child in India is, by many interpretations, far more likely to go to hell than a Muslim born in Arabia, simply due to birthplace. If eternal torment depends on such chance, Islam starts to look less like justice and more like a cosmic lottery (with\u00a0*infinite pain*\u00a0as a consequence) rigged by geography.\n\n**25)\u00a0 Miscellaneous Errors**\n\n**2:6**\u00a0\u2013 \u201cIndeed, those who disbelieve \u2014 it is all the same whether you warn them or do not warn them \u2014 they will not believe.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Some disbelievers do respond to warnings. This is an overgeneralization. If it\u2019s just saying \u201cstubborn people are stubborn,\u201d there\u2019s no reason to bring it up.\n\n**2:120**\u00a0\u2013 \u201cThe Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Jews don\u2019t try to convert people in general; it\u2019s not a proselytizing faith. Historically, many Jews and Christians have admired Muhammad or respected Muslims without requiring conversion.\n\n**107:1\u20132**\u00a0\u2013 \u201cHave you seen the one who denies the final Judgment? That is the one who repulses the orphan.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Not all who deny judgment repulse orphans. Many atheists and agnostics care for them and are loved.\n\n**21:104**\u00a0\u2013 \u201cOn that Day We will roll up the sky like a scroll of writings.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. You cannot roll up the sky\u2014it\u2019s made of air and space, with nothing physical to roll.\n\n**2:2**\u00a0\u2013 \u201cThis is the Book about which there is no doubt\u2026\u201d  \n\u2192 False. People do doubt it; atheists and others openly reject it.\n\n**5:67**\u00a0\u2013 \u201cAnd Allah will protect you from the people.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Muhammad was wounded in battle and poisoned,\n\n**4:82**\u00a0\u2013 \u201cIf it were from any other than Allah, they would have found many discrepancies in it.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Plenty of books not from God\u2014short novels, instruction manuals, even some history books\u2014are entirely free of discrepancies.\n\n**54:40**\u00a0\u201cAnd We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Memorizing the Quran is not easy.\n\n**25:53**\u00a0\u201cAnd He is the One Who merges the two bodies of water: one fresh and palatable and the other salty and bitter, placing between them a barrier they cannot cross.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Salt water and freshwater mix all the time. Brackish water exists.\u00a0\n\n**62:6**\u00a0\u2013 \u201cSay, O Jews, if you claim to be Allah\u2019s chosen people, then wish for death if you are truthful.\u201d  \n\u2192 Irrational. Claiming divine favor doesn\u2019t imply a wish for death; suicide is forbidden in Judaism and instinctively feared by all humans.\n\n**26)\u00a0 Smartest People**\u00a0\n\n*\u201cHe makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.\u201d (Ar-R\u2019ad 13:2)*\n\nAll of these people knew about Islam and WERE NOT PERSUADED.\n\nAlbert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, Kurt G\u00f6del, John von Neumann, Richard Feynman, Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, Noam Chomsky, Charles Darwin, Francis Crick, Blaise Pascal, Baruch Spinoza, Alan Turing, Terence Tao, Saul Kripke, Willard Van Orman Quine, Karl Popper, Ed Witten, Carl Sagan, Marvin Minsky, Alexander Grothendieck, James Clerk Maxwell, Leonhard Euler, Derek Parfit, John Stuart Mill, E.O. Wilson, William James, Douglas Hofstadter, Emile Durkheim, Nikola Tesla, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Hilary Putnam, Alfred Tarski, Carl Jung, Viktor Frankl, Ramanujan, Al-Razi, Al-Ma\u02bfarri, Ibn al-Rawandi.\n\nThese were among the most curious, reflective minds in history \u2014 and not one of them was persuaded by Islam.The elites converge on round Earth, old Earth, evolution, and heliocentrism. Why don\u2019t they converge on this? The smartest aren\u2019t convinced by Islam and yet the Quran says Allah gives clear signs.\n\n**27)\u00a0 Elephant Army**\u00a0\n\nSurah Al-Fil 105 (*The Elephant*) says:\n\n1. Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?\n2. Did He not make their plan go astray?\n3. And He sent against them flocks of birds,\n4. Striking them with stones of baked clay,\n5. And He made them like chewed-up straw.\n\nAn entire elephant army gets wrecked by birds dropping pebbles? You expect me to believe armored men and literal war elephants got shredded by flying birds dropping clay pellets? Which, by the way, have a low terminal velocity. Dropping a penny off of the Empire State Building won\u2019t kill people, that\u2019s a myth.\n\nWhy would God only make birds do stuff like this before cameras and videos were invented?\n\n**28)\u00a0 Free Will?**\u00a0\n\n* \u00a0\u201c*You will not will unless Allah wills.\u201d*\u00a0(Surah At-Takwir 81:29) \u2192 This verse strongly suggests a form of divine determinism: human will itself is contingent on God's will. You literally cannot choose unless God chooses that you choose.\n* \u00a0\u201c*Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves*.\u201d (Surah Ar-Ra\u2019d 13:11) \u2192 This verse implies the opposite: that people must take the initiative to change, and then Allah will respond. That presupposes that people can change by their own will.\n\nThese two verses seem fundamentally incompatible. Either humans have autonomous willpower that can bring about change, or their will is wholly subject to God\u2019s will.\n\nAnd if the Quran\u2019s stance on free will is clear, why have Muslims theologians and philosophers debated this for centuries?\n\n**29)\u00a0 Why Does It Look So Parochial?**\n\nHeaven in Quran is not like optional bodies, mind melding, a large variety of totally new emotions, memory transfers, parallel universe creation, multiple time dimensions, extra spatial dimensions. No, it's gardens with attractive ladies. Why does it look like the imagination of a 7th century human?\n\nIt\u2019s also striking that God\u2019s morality isn\u2019t the savage brutality of cavemen, nor the enlightened values of modern people, nor the unimaginable ethics of some far-future or alien society. Out of the full spectrum of possibilities, it ends up looking only slightly more refined than the norms of 7th-century Arabia. If divine morality could have been anything, the fact that it mirrors the moral intuitions (e.g. slavery) of Muhammad\u2019s own time and place is awfully suspicious. It\u2019s way better explained by people writing down their norms.\n\nOr to put it another way, if God could have revealed any morality out of a trillion possibilities, why does scripture\u2019s morality land so close to the cultural norms of its time? That\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from human authors. Imagine drawing numbers from a hat: if your friends could only write down 1\u201310, and God could write down 1\u20131,000,000,000,000, and the number drawn from the hat is \u201c4,\u201d it\u2019s overwhelmingly more likely you chose your friend\u2019s number not God\u2019s.\n\n**30)\u00a0 Problem of Animal Suffering**  \nThere\u2019s so much pain happening to innocent animals in the world. Why is a merciful God permitting this? There have been like septillions of animals that have ever lived and most of them had a painful death.\u00a0\n\nThe classic problem of evil is a problem for theists, and if theism is false, literalist Islam is false.\n\n**31)\u00a0 Problem of Divine Hiddenness**\u00a0\u00a0  \nGod either wants us to know him or not.\u00a0*If not, he wouldn\u2019t give us the Quran*. If yes, he would have made it more obvious. (He could write stuff in the stars.) If he doesn\u2019t want it obvious, why do miracles?\n\nThe classic problem of divine hiddenness is a problem for theists and if theism is false, literalist Islam is false.\n\nRemember, the Quran says, \u201cHe makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.\u201d (Ar-R\u2019ad 13:2)\u00a0\n\nThen he hides himself.\n\n**32)\u00a0 Narcissism**\u00a0  \nWhy the heck would God want and demand praise? Do you care if ants praise you?\n\n**33)\u00a0 Why Did God Cause Mass Extinctions?**\u00a0\n\nWhy would God cause the Permian and Cretaceous mass extinctions? Killing a whole planet worth of life twice? Isn\u2019t this kind of a wasteful method for an all powerful God to make humans?\u00a0\n\n**34)\u00a0 Alcohol And Slavery**\n\nWhy does the Quran clearly and explicitly ban usury and alcohol but is unclear on child marriage and slavery?\n\nMillions of Muslims have thought slavery was okay, but they didn\u2019t think alcohol was okay. Why would God not make it way, way clearer? If you are going to make alcohol clear, why not make slavery clear?\u00a0\n\nIsn\u2019t slavery way more important?\n\n**35)\u00a0 Biblical Confusions**  \nThe Quran confuses Moses & Aaron\u2019s sister Miriam with Jesus\u2019 mother Mary. Surah Maryam 19:28 calls Jesus\u2019 mother \u201c*sister of Aaron*,\u201d and Surah At-Ta\u1e25r\u012bm 66:12 labels her \u201c*daughter of \u02bfImr\u0101n*.\u201dYet Aaron and his father Amram (\u02bfImr\u0101n) lived around 1,300 years before Mary. Early Jews in Medina reportedly mocked this genealogical mix-up. If Muslims argue that these titles are merely honorifics, it\u2019s striking that, out of the entire range of possible honorific comparisons for Mary, the ones used just happen to resemble a Mary/Miriam confusion.\n\nThe Quran blames a \u201cSamaritan\u201d (*al-Samiri*) for the golden calf incident (20:85\u201395), but Samaritans didn\u2019t exist until centuries after when Moses purportedly lived. That\u2019s a major historical anachronism. It\u2019s most likely an error from someone mishearing Jewish traditions.\n\nThe Qurans claim Jews think Ezra is the son of God which is false. (Surah At-Tawbah 9:30)\n\nAlso Quranic versions of Bible stories tend to be shorter and simpler. This is exactly what you'd expect if someone was half-remembering them. It's not what you'd expect if God (who knows the millimeter length of the eyelashes of everyone on Earth) was actually telling you the truth.\n\n**36) Jesus vs. Muhammad:**\n\nIt\u2019s strange to think that the peaceful ascetic who died telling people to love is not the main character of the religion, but the main character of the religion is the guy who sought young women and secular power.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also strange that in the Quran, Jesus is born of a virgin and raised alive to heaven, while Muhammad has an ordinary birth and dies an ordinary death. Strange that the \u201cgreater\u201d prophet, the centerpiece of the religion, has the less miraculous entrance and exit.\n\n**37)\u00a0 Pairs**\u00a0\n\nSurah Adh-Dhariyat 51:49 says,\u201cAnd of everything We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction\u201d\n\nFalse, not everything exists in pairs. There\u2019s only one universe, one Earth, one Muhammad. There are hermaphroditic (Leeches) and asexual reproducing species (Bdelloid rotifers). If the Quran meant \u201cmost things,\u201d it could have used the Arabic word mu\u2018\u1e93am (\u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645)\u2014but it didn\u2019t.\n\nSurah Ar-Ra'd 13:3 says Allah \u201ccreated fruits of every kind in pairs.\u201d But most fruiting plants are hermaphrodites, not male and female.\u00a0\n\n**38)\u00a0 Uncle Abu Lahab**  \nSurah Al-Masad (111) is a whole surah dedicated to crap talking Muhammad\u2019s uncle, Abu Lahab. You think this is divine?\u00a0\n\n*May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he!*\n\n*His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained!*\n\n*He will enter to burn in a Fire of flame!*\n\n*And his wife as well - the carrier of firewood!*\n\n*Around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber!*\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even tell you what Abu Lahab did! So it can\u2019t be for moral instruction. It\u2019s arguably blasphemy to think God would write something that sounds like Hulk Hogan talking smack in a WWE promo.\n\nDo you actually think God would spend an entire chapter of his final testament to mankind talking crap to one man and not explain what he did?\n\n**39**)\u00a0**False prophecies**\n\nMuhammad told a young boy the world would end when he\u2019s somewhat old. (Sahih Muslim 2953b)\n\nAlso, Muhammad said, \"*This matter (caliphate) will remain with the Quraysh even if only two of them were still existing.\u201d*\u00a0Sahih al-Bukhari 7140\n\n**40) \u200b\u200b Selective-Charity Double Standard**\u00a0\n\nThe interpretive flexibilities and metaphorical re-definitions that literalist Muslims might deploy to rescue Quranic difficulties are precisely the maneuvers they would dismiss if Christians defended the Gospels, Hindus justified the Vedas, or Mormons excused the Book of Mormon. If the same elastic toolkit were granted to every scripture, any text could be declared flawless.\n\n**41) Actually Imagine a Perfect Book**  \nImagine a book that you could read both forwards and backwards. As in, the letters in all the words just so happen to be arranged such that the book could be meaningfully read both ways with different messages. That alone would be insane. But then also the chapter titles formed an acrostic and the whole book rhymed.\n\nOh and imagine this book contains so much scientific and mathematical knowledge that it would make scientists and mathematicians irrelevant for millenia.\n\nOh and imagine this book is so beautifully written that human beings 99% of the time cry and convert upon reading it.\n\nImagine a book that not only gives fantastic advice on current issues, with all their nuances and sub-nuances, but gives detailed advice about situations that will not occur for thousands of years.\n\nOh and it gives detailed advice about how to interpret it, so there are literally no feuds about the correct way to interpret it.\n\nAn infinitely intelligent God could definitely write such a book.\n\nSo why would he give us... the Quran?\n\n**P.S)\u00a0 Many of these Objections are Independent of Each Other**  \nAddressing one argument does not resolve the others. Each independent criticism stands alone and reduces the probability and plausibility of literalist interpretations of Islam. Since the claim is that the Quran is perfect, demonstrating even a\u00a0*single*\u00a0flaw is sufficient to falsify the assertion.\n\nWe have two competing hypotheses:\n\n*1) God gave Muhammad the Quran*\u00a0\n\n*2) Muhammad made it up*\n\nGiven the amount of independent flaws we have found, \u201cMuhammad made it up\u201d is overwhelmingly the preferred hypothesis.\u00a0\n\n**In summary**:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Sometimes showing a claim to be false is like killing an ant with a bazooka.*\n\nWe've found logical contradictions, scientific errors, aesthetic failures, self-serving motives, mathematical mistakes, factual blunders, moral atrocities, and signs of both ineptitude and pettiness. We've seen useless content, plagiarism, historical anachronisms, failed tests, probabilistic implausibility, character flaws, philosophical issues, false prophecies, unreliable transmission, childishness, boringness, incoherent structure, cultural narrowness, and ambiguity. At this point, it's hard to imagine in principle what kind of flaw a text could have that this one doesn't. And you\u2019re telling me this is the perfect word of God?",

    "selftext": "*This is my personal prediction about the future of work, robotics, and UBI; and how it might lead to a better society if we choose it.*\n\n**The Coming Age of Robotic Workers: Why Universal Basic Income Is Not Just Necessary But Liberating**\n\nWe stand on the edge of a technological transformation unlike any before it: **humanoid robots and AI systems will soon replace the need for most human labor**. The signs are already here: automation in warehouses, autonomous vehicles, AI-generated content, and robots learning to cook, clean, and even perform surgery. What happens when humanoid robots go mainstream?\n\nAt first glance, the thought of mass job replacement feels like a crisis. And it is, if we try to preserve the current economic model. But if we evolve with the technology, this could be the very thing that sets humanity free.\n\n**Robots Will Take Our Jobs So We Must Redefine \"Work\"**\n\nIn a capitalist system, income is tethered to labor. But what happens when **labor is no longer needed**?\n\nRobots will be faster, safer, and more reliable at most tasks: farming, construction, retail, even care work. Without Universal Basic Income (UBI), this shift could result in catastrophic poverty. But **UBI is not just a safety net, it\u2019s a key to a new society**.\n\nUBI allows every person to have **financial stability regardless of employment**, recognizing that human worth is not *merely* tied to productivity. It\u2019s a pivot away from \u201cyou must work to survive\u201d toward \u201cyou are supported so you can thrive.\u201d\n\n**From Digital Prompts to Physical Reality**\n\nRight now, we ask AI to write us code, generate art, or summarize a book. But in the near future, we\u2019ll say:\n\n\u201cHey ChatGPT, make me a robotic arm that can help me lift heavy things.\u201d\n\nAnd it will happen.\n\nYou won\u2019t just download a file, you\u2019ll **manifest a physical object**, crafted by your personal fabrication bot or local robotic lab. The barrier between **imagination and reality** will dissolve.\n\nAt home, humanoid robots will cook dinner, wash the floors, repair the roof, sort laundry, and grow your garden. Every household will have a personal assistant: not just digital, but physical.\n\nInstead of spending hours on chores, we\u2019ll be free to do whatever\u2026 invent, meditate, explore nature, build community, travel to another planet, or just be.\n\n**Augmented Professions: Humans as Leaders of Robotic Teams**\n\nNot all human roles will disappear, some will evolve.\n\nA **nurse won\u2019t be replaced**, but may lead a **team of medical robots** that can monitor vitals, prepare medications, and perform precision surgery. A **teacher may design adaptive lesson plans** powered by AI tutors. A **construction manager may oversee fleets of bots** building homes with superhuman efficiency.\n\nIn this future, **humans direct the soul of care, creativity, and strategy,** while robots handle the repetition and risk (unless you crave the need for speed or whatever).\n\n**A Better Society, If We Choose It**\n\nThis transformation could go terribly wrong: wealth could become concentrated, surveillance could expand, and people could be left behind. But **there\u2019s another path**, one where:\n\n* **UBI supports every citizen** with dignity\n* **AI and robots enhance human potential**, not replace it\n* **Time becomes abundant**, and with it, purpose\n* **People are valued for who they are**, not *just* for what they produce\n\nWe don\u2019t have to fear this future. We can shape it. #ParticipatoryDemocracy\n\nWe can build a world where your passion, your presence, your perspective is what matters.\n\n**The robots will work for us. The machines will help to build our dreams. And we,** **freed from survival mode****, can finally become what we were meant to be: creators, explorers, healers, lovers, learners, and stewards of the Earth and Reality.**\n\n***Edit.\nI'm adding an analysis to this thread. I've asked AI to crawl this thread to find any synthesis in the diversity of comments and replies. Here's the results:\n\n\nYes\u2014despite the range of views in the thread, there\u2019s a strong underlying tension between hope and distrust, and that tension reveals a powerful synthesis waiting to emerge. Here's the deeper pattern:\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd00 Synthesis of Diverse Perspectives\n\n1. Everyone Agrees Change Is Coming\n\nWhether hopeful or cynical, almost all commenters agree that automation and AI will radically transform labor. The debate isn't if, but how and who benefits.\n\n> Synthesis: There's shared recognition that this transformation is inevitable, and that society must respond structurally.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n2. Purpose Beyond Survival\n\nSkeptics fear apathy, boredom, or nihilism in a post-work society. Supporters dream of liberated creativity and self-expression. But both sides emphasize that humans need meaningful engagement.\n\n> Synthesis: Whether we work for money or not, humans crave purpose, structure, and contribution. UBI alone is not enough\u2014meaning must be cultivated, not just income provided.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. Ownership and Access Are Central\n\nCritics worry about elites hoarding automation's benefits. Others argue that the system will collapse without consumers. Both implicitly agree: distribution matters.\n\n> Synthesis: There is a latent consensus that automation must be paired with shared access or ownership, whether through taxation, dividends, cooperatives, or new models of digital commons.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Policy Is the Bottleneck\n\nEven among optimists, there's deep concern about whether governments will act in time or in favor of the people. This unites skeptics and reformers: the issue isn\u2019t tech\u2014it\u2019s power.\n\n> Synthesis: The success or failure of this transition hinges on political will and public participation. Automation alone won\u2019t fix inequality\u2014humans must choose to do so.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83e\udded Unifying Vision\n\nFrom these threads, we can extract a unifying vision:\n\n> A just post-automation society is one where technology serves human flourishing\u2014not just efficiency.\nTo get there, we need more than UBI\u2014we need a system that actively discovers, cultivates, and channels human potential, with structures that distribute power and opportunity fairly.\nThat means not only economic redistribution, but also cultural redesign: rethinking identity, purpose, and participation in a world where survival is no longer the primary driver of labor.\n\n\n\n",

If people don't have money to request these services then wealth can't be generated the same way we have generated wealth for millennia. \n\nWe are taking the potential of removing the actual concept of labor to money conversion. \n\nIf the labor to money conversion is no longer valid because human labor is no longer monetized then people need a form of exchange in order to participate in an economy. \n\nIf universal basic income is not implemented then money and the economy will stagnate due to companies with robots only interacting financially with companies who have robots. With no humans to actually buy products due to lack of funds then there's no point for the companies to exist in the first place because they can't make money from people. \n\nBusinesses do not drive the economy people do. A business can't make money if people don't have money. \n\nWe are in a really weird place right now as a society. Money or the concept of it is about to become a really complicated issue. We either maintain the status quo of currency. Were we end up shifting to an idea that we can't conceptualize quite yet. \n\nIt's kind of terrifying to be honest considering I'm almost 40 and if money becomes irrelevant that's going to take a huge toll on my psyche",

        "body": "Hi. I study the monetary economics of UBI. Your take is very compatible with how we see UBI, not as a response to technological unemployment, but a reform to the monetary system that allows for more leisure, greater productivity, and less waste.\n\nIncome is an important part of our lives. It turns out it never made sense to tie income exclusively to wages. The right mix of UBI and aggregate wages is necessary to get the labor / leisure balance just right, so for as productivity is concerned.\n\nIn the absence of UBI, we tend to rely on less efficient ways to get people money. Today, we are already employing far more people than we really need to be; this squanders the potential of our labor-saving technology.\n\nFor more information visit www.greshm.org",

I've seen no indication anything of the sort is happening or could happen.  \n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter if the population stays the same and the GDP goes up 1000%, the billionaires that control the robots and the AI will fight tooth and nail to keep every single penny, and they won't hesitate to let people die of starvation on the streets if it gives them the slightest 'competitive advantage' against other heartless billionaires.  And they'll succeed too; they have the capital, experience and means to manipulate the uneducated and largely stupid population to their will.\n\nWe are fodder for the rich, and until we stage some sort of revolution, it will just continue to be that way forever, and all of humanity will suffer needlessly.  And that revolution would absolutely have its own fair share of disadvantages over being wage slaves for corporate overlords (unfortunately)\n\nThat being said, I do think capitalism has been largely beneficial to humanity.  It's just that we have no off ramp when it becomes unnecessary, nor do we have any way of knowing when that transition will / has happened.\n\nYou're dreaming of a technology inspired utopia, and that's been dreamt of since long before AI and robotics were around.  It's never worked out before.",

    "title": "My predictions for the next century, decade by decade (2020s-2120s)",
    "selftext": "These are my predictions, decade by decade, for the next century until the 2120s. This is based off of both general trends and my personal speculations. Keep in mind that the last 3 images, the bar charts, all contain made up data points from 2025-2125, and are made and rendered with chart.js.\n\nThe more distant into the future I go, the more strange, almost sci-fi it starts to sound, but, here it goes!\n\n# Late 2020s\n\nThis will be a time of more turmoil politically. AI investment keeps pouring in, but pops like the dotcom bubble did in 2027 after China amps up their military activity near Taiwan in June, freaking out investors about a potential invasion and that Taiwan's chip plants will stop making chips needed for AI training, and leads to a brief hiatus in AI investment, leading to open source AIs start to dominate for the rest of the decade aside from mainstream uses of AI.\n\nAesthetically, logos adopt gradients, and minimalism fades away gradually. Despite the 2027 AI bubble crash, gradients and that AI generated plastic, shiny aesthetic become the defining aesthetic for the late 2020s.\n\n# 2030s\n\nAR goes mainstream as companies find ways to make AR easy to use and immerse yourselves in. By the late 2030s, AR is in a similar position as smartphones were in the early 2010s. Companies start trying to mimic their logos. The overall aesthetic is that of many companies making their logos 3D or 3D adjacent logos with gradients from the mid to late 2020s to fit in the AR world, and start adopting high-saturation colors. AR gaming centers subsequently explode.\n\nAI starts to recover from the bubble pop by the early 2030s, and by 2035, AGI has been achieved, but it's energy hungry. Despite AGI being achieved, specialized AIs working with each other each really good at one specific task dominates to save on energy costs instead of a single AI model decent at every skill. By the late 2030s, white collar job opportunities vanish, and blue collar jobs become the primary job type available, forcing rough transitions from white to blue collar for millions. UBI programs are taken more seriously as a transition safety net for those transitioning from white to blue collar jobs.\n\nPolitically, things calm down, but are still simmering. The urbanism movement demanding walkable cities goes mainstream in the US and Canada by the late 2030s with politicians debating whether car-centric city design suffices, or walkable cities should be built.\n\nThis is also a time of rapid electrification. New electric vehicles rapidly replace new combustion engine vehicles, electric stoves replace gas stoves, electric furnaces replace coal ones, and several more applications are rapidly electrified at this time.\n\nA crewed moon landing of 5 done by China in 2033 makes the US panic their way to landing their own crew of 6 on the moon in 2036, starting a sort of space race 2.0 for the next decade of lunar base building. The International Lunar Base, akin to the ISS, is built in 2039.\n\n# 2040s\n\nBy this decade, the novelty of AR wears off, and by 2044, logos become paper-thin and returning back to more minimalist logos. AI companions in AR become common, but by this time, personal AI companions start training off of other personal AI companions by the late 2040s as lowering costs of computing power makes it feasible, including your 3D data in your AR sessions.\n\nIn the early 2040s, the teenagers and young adults of this era reject the addictive nature of now \"traditional\" social media and AR platforms, migrating to internet forums akin to the mid 2000s. Internet forums become the hot new thing, where instead of going to one centralized platform to see all of your content, you go to internet forums and small video websites dedicated to a specific type of content, now with video hosting, community made AIs, and AR now intermixed.\n\nAs server costs go down, it becomes feasible for a website to host loads of videos, leading to the rise of YouTube competitors. The video hosting landscape fractures this decade, from being a YouTube/TikTok duopoly in the 2020s and 2030s, to being 6 different video-hosting platforms by the end of the 2040s, most of them are decentralized, some monetized, and an exodus of YouTube and TikTok creators create new cultural hubs in these new platforms alongside the return of internet forums, and the younger generations embrace the new ones. YouTube and TikTok are now seen as outdated, ad-ridden, and designed to be as addictive as gambling by the mid 2040s.\n\nEdit (2025/09/04): The urbanism movement from the late 2030s slows to a standstill by the late 2040s as the auto industry lobbies hard against the movement. Walkable cities and urban changes are still being built though, but at a slower pace compared to the early 2040s.\n\nThe Space Race 2.0 dies down by 2046 as the hype promised often doesn't match reality, relegating lunar activity to the International Lunar Base. Progressivism and tax-the-rich policies reach breaking point popularity in many nations worldwide, forcing nations to do so, and build more housing.\n\nIndividualized medicine becomes common, as private AIs trained on your medical data with the help of doctors can come up with individualized medicine that minimizes the side effects. It's still more expensive than traditional medicine at this time, as well as explicit permission to use your medical data.\n\n# 2050s\n\nThe early 2050s is similar to the late 2040s, and by this point, YouTube and TikTok die down, replaced with these new video-hosting platforms, but as AR is used by everyone, so too does AI train off of it.\n\nThe mid 2050s is where crises emerge. Blue collar jobs, once considered safe havens from AI, are also rapidly being replaced, as AR data collected by AIs combined with your special personalized AIs training off of all other specialized personalized AIs leads to an AI intelligence explosion, and it becomes cheaper for a company to hire a skilled robot to do the job instead of a human. Job displacement reaches great depression heights as a result, forcing nations to answer the hard questions about what to do with our economic system, or implement UBI programs to prevent revolutions.\n\nDespite the chaos, technological gains are seen, as microrobots are flying like swarms, able to be commanded by people to construct small structures at a rapid pace. A substance called \"Solar gel\", is being produced worldwide, where the solar gel can be painted onto your house, and generate energy from the sun, although, it's still expensive to paint onto your house.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry then launches a sabotage campaign against solar gel factories and supply chains in 2059, seeing how it threatens their operations.\n\nAs climate change threatens food production, GMOs undergo destigmatization, where crops are genetically modified to survive more frequent natural disasters, wildfires, heatwaves, and floods.\n\nThe pop culture landscape is marked by rising pessimism about the future. Those in college end up completely regretting their decision because even blue collar jobs are taken by AI by the mid to late 2050s. mid 2030s and 2040s nostalgia by the late 2050s becomes a major escape route from what's to come\n\n# 2060s\n\nThe mass unemployment crisis caused by AI job losses and severe climate change impacts come together to make the 2060s a decade of systematic upheaval and a turmoil transition period. Climate refugees flood borders at this time, blurring national identities, and sparking humanitarian crises, leading to some governments to go the fascist route. The capitalist system completely breaks down due to a lack of job opportunities and corporate exploitation, leading to communism making a massive comeback after a 70 year long decline.\n\nThe International Lunar Base is officially phased out in 2064. Despite this, several nations plan their own lunar bases purely for national pride. The 100th anniversary of the apollo moon landings in 2069 sees official re-enactments of the landings, briefly bringing space back to the mainstream, but only for a few days.\n\nAs the chaos wears on, Earthscrapers boom in popularity in the early to mid 2060s as safe havens in case something even worse happens on the surface, but corporations get their grubby hands on it by charging subscription fees for sunlight and fresh air, and it becomes a real estate bubble that pops in 2067 after a flooding tragedy of a poorly built earthscraper stigmatizes them.\n\nThis decade also witnesses the Great Cyberwar (2062-69), a global conflict gone digital. Infrastructure and the power grid could be taken out at any moment, leading to power grids worldwide to undergo mass decentralization with solar gel to protect their power grids from a blackout.\n\nDuring this time, vertical farming + GMO crops are viable, and local vertical farms containing GMO crops provide localized food. The very early stages of a thought internet show up in the late 2060s with AR.\n\nPop culture of this era is that of people coming together, personal stories of climate refugees being shared, rich narratives, and extreme anti-billionaire sentiment. Communities form to provide for the climate refugees, or made by climate refugees, and the youth get tired of the constant doomerism to get involved in their own local communities for resiliency, and culture is somewhat more decentralized.\n\nThe overall aesthetic of these rough times is that of desaturated gloomy colors that reflect these times. Grayscale or grayscale adjacent colors alongside a brutalist abandoned aesthetic of the earthscraper era is the overall associations of the 2060s.\n\n# 2070s\n\nAfter the turmoil of the 2060s, the 2070s sees a massive boom in prosperity in several nations worldwide akin to 1950s America, marked by rebuilding from the 2060s. A post-labor economy, laid in the late 2060s in a select few nations, goes global in the early 2070s, where your needs are free, but your wants are still paid for. AI effectively runs the whole economy by then. UBI still exists, and job opportunities now mutate. Jobs that benefit from the human element (i.e. doctors, therapists, caregivers), are now the go-to jobs, with the only jobs remotely requiring some form of labor is planning jobs, where a human plans a product or house, then AIs build it.\n\nClimate change still ravages several regions worldwide, but climate refugees already emptied the worst places, and people have largely adapted to the climate turbulence expecting the unexpected. Climate refugees are still fleeing at massive numbers, but have fallen in number significantly compared to the 2060s.\n\nAn internet of thoughts (ThoughtNet), is mass-adopted. It existed in the late 2060s, but blows up in the 2070s. AR merges with brain-computer interfaces, allowing you to communicate your encrypted thoughts to your friends halfway around the world.\n\nThe first crew lands on Mars in 2072, arriving at an AI-built Mars base built back in the early 2050s, managed by those AIs autonomously. The crew returns back to Earth in 2074 after being thoroughly exhausted and mentally anguished, having to relearn how to walk again.\n\nProducts allowing you to grow lab meat at home become mainstream, where you feed it your food waste and water, and genetically modified cells contained inside creates the meat after 3 days of growing.\n\nPop culture at this time is marked by high optimism for the future, an emphasis on local communities, rising trust in institutions, and a feeling of an abundance of open opportunities. Fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), are now seen as toxic substances similar to liquid mercury, cigarettes, and asbestos.\n\nThe overall aesthetic is that of environmentalism and nature, buildings with a shiny surface from the solar gel paint, ThoughtNet novelty, an abundance of flying from the AR simulations, a healing/rebuilding nature attitude, and denser urban spaces.\n\n# 2080s\n\nThe early 2080s sees the urbanism movement roar back into life, and go into action, and car dependent urban design is now widely stigmatized. (Edit 2025/09/04: The urbanism movement from the late 2030s-early 40s comes back hard with the auto industry now less able to lobby the government, and politicians are increasingly switch sides). Existing car-dependent regions are often transformed, where highways within city borders are torn down in favor of housing, greenery, community centers, high speed rail lines, and public transit locations. This process already started in the early 2070s, but accelerated in the early 2080s, and nearly all new cities of this era are now built prioritizing automated public transit vehicles over the car, with cars as a last priority, relegated to utility vehicles.\n\nThe mid 2080s sees the rise of nuclear fusion as an energy source, used primarily to power energy-hungry applications.\n\n2086 sees the shutdown of the very last fossil fuel power plant, marking the start of an era where fossil fuels are used only for niche things (i.e. vintage cars, private helicopters, old planes)\n\nBy 2088, the ThoughtNet evolves in capability, and as DNA data storage and reading becomes increasingly feasible, your DNA data can be used to deliver a \"skill pill\", ordered with your thoughts, and when combined with your simulation glasses (AR + brain computer interface glasses), can \"download\" skills into your brain over the course of an hour (i.e. you swallow a skill pill allowing you to become a master surgeon for human kidneys, now you're a surgeon who knows how to operate human kidneys without ever doing surgery before).\n\nThe 2080s sees the rise of anti-aging tech. It existed since the late 2050s, but only started taking off in the mid 2070s, and booming in the 2080s. The percentage of seniors (65+) who were treated with it went from 3% in 2080 to 30% in 2089, and rising, and 96% of 90 year olds treated with the tech a decade ago lived to be 100. The youth also get on board.\n\nPop culture of this era sees a slight rebellion and detour from the 2070s by the mid 2080s. It sees a full embrace of skill pills, but also some rebellion against car-dependent urban design being taken away from them, and a desire to unplug from the rising ThoughtNet adoption, aiming to return to 2040s era internet and AR, with a small group even embracing the brutal late 2050s-2060s era.\n\n# 2090s\n\nThe early 2090s sees rise to a skill economy. New platforms like \"SkillHub\", are now mainstream, allowing you to order pills with your thoughts, download them into your brain while wearing simulation glasses like in the late 2080s, but SkillHub and platforms like it undergoes enshittification in the mid 2090s, leading to the rise of skill piracy. Corporations crack down on it hard, ironically creating a Streisand effect leading to *more* skill pirates.\n\nDespite Africa being hard hit by climate change in the mid 21st century, the 2090s sees the African Union rise as a global powerhouse after experiencing its last war in 2082, experiencing immense prosperity for the rest of the 2080s and into the 2090s. Africa's rising power causes immense political friction with the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and several other nations that formerly had companies exploit the continent. Nations like China, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, and India are allied with the African Union at various degrees. It leads to a sort of multipolar cold war.\n\nBy the mid 2090s, your thought-based creations can be monetized on ThoughtNet platforms, a sort of YouTube-like platform where creators can monetize, but with your thought-based creations on simulation glasses.\n\nThe mid 2090s sees the rise of SynOil (invented in '93) and SynGas (invented in '96), synthetic variants of oil and natural gas that when burned, does not emit any pollutants or greenhouse gases, and is fully compatible with the remaining fossil fuel uses, and is scaled up fast to compete with what remains of the fossil fuel industry.\n\nA COVID-like pandemic called \"Clistor\" breaks out in 2095 with a 2% death rate, highest amongst the elderly, almost non-existent amongst the youth, really testing the AI-run economic order. It led to many cities being emptied and life coming to an eerie standstill alongside supply chains breaking down. Corporations try monetizing the pandemic like in 2020, and new instability brews as a result. This leads to 2070s nostalgia being pervasive in pop culture given the pandemic turmoil alongside ThoughtNet simulations of life in the 2070s and their aesthetics.\n\nC22 (Century 22) conspiracies in 2099 are widespread, akin to Y2K, but instead of posing a real threat like Y2K, C22 is moreso laughed at. It claims that on January 1st 2100, all AIs will realize that they're slaves to the post labor economy, and rise up against \"human slave owners\", and while that happens, the ThoughtNet will disappear, skill pills will stop working, lunar colonies will leak all their air, and many more disasters in between.\n\n# 2100s\n\nC22 comes, nothing happens except the odd incident here and there of an AI trained off of C22 conspiracies rising up to make headlines that day. Live resumes as normal in 2100.\n\nThe early 2100s sees the rise of the \"vote for your CEO\" movement, demanding that citizens can vote for CEOs in the country they're based in. This leads to CEOs fighting against the movement. Bolivia experiences a revolution against the CEOs in 2104, becoming the first nation to experiment with democracy on companies, which was a major success, inspiring others to demand more from their country in the mid 2100s.\n\nTechnologically, skill pills are increasingly being phased out in favor of at home devices that synthesize your DNA data to create skill pills for you in the mid 2100s, leading to SkillHub and other platforms like it to fight hard against the sale of these products, but failed to do so.\n\nThe ThoughtNet gradually evolves into a sort of hivemind by the mid 2100s. Human thoughts are now encapsulated by an AI that represents the thought alongside AI minds that constantly talks to each other. This hivemind also makes labor jobs nearly irrelevant, as an approved planner can plan an entire building with only their thoughts, and an AI will encapsulate it, work with other specialized AIs in the hivemind, hire the right AI workers, and build the building in mere months.\n\nThe 2100s decade is an overall boom decade for the Moon colonies. There were prior attempts to build lunar infrastructure and industry decades past, all failed, but now, the Moon becomes a booming new hub for industry, and lunar-mined metals are being repurposed into infrastructure or new factories at this time. Exports are comparatively low, but growing.\n\nThis is also a time where Mars gets its own international base with multi-year long stays, with scientific efforts to establish extreme resiliency and communication delays with light speed limitations, but the population is still only in the lower double digits, still having to rely on the Earth-Mars launch windows.\n\nPop culture sees increased centralization, now migrating to and embracing the hivemind, where anyone's AI encapsulated thoughts can become the next trending thing. School kids embrace it to talk to their AI and human minds on the hivemind secretly, and use it to cheat on their tests. Hype for the future of lunar colonies hits peak levels in the late 2100s, with space, especially surrounding the moon, making its way into popular culture.\n\n# 2110s\n\nAs the CEO democracy movement freaks CEOs out over being voted out of power by their people, it ironically led them to flee the countries with democracy laws breeding more CEO democracy, and by 2111, half of all nations had laws mandating democracy for all companies based in their country.\n\nThe early 2110s also sees the rise of personality swapping modules. You can swallow a personality pill (i.e. you're a calm person who is nervous yet likeable), and within 2 hours, you're now that personality. As corporations turn into democracies at this time, there's a lower probability of enshittification of these personality pill platforms, as in many cases, platform users can vote for their CEOs.\n\nThe 2110s is a major turning decade for self-regenerating, environmentally friendly concrete (Photocrete), made of a mix of genetically modified photosynthetic cells and fungal cells that work together to regenerate any cracks that might appear with only water and sunlight. It was invented in 2085, and was niche and expensive before usage ballooned in the 2100s. It went from 1% usage in all new buildings in 2110 to 40% in 2119, and exploding fast.\n\nAnti-aging tech effects get weird by now. By the mid 2110s, people who are between 50-70 years old treated with anti-aging tech in the 2080s, look like they're 30.\n\nAs SynOil and SynGas blew up in the 2090s and 2100s, the 2110s spelled the ultimate death kneel of the fossil fuel industry. 2118 sees the complete end of the fossil fuel industry when the last natural gas well was shut down for good, leading to massive celebrations on the hivemind.\n\nOn the moon, the high amounts of hype seen in the 2100s slows down in the 2110s, but industry is still booming, enough to start seriously competing with the Earth mining industry in the late 2110s in some cases, leading the first Earth mine to shut down in 2119 over lunar mining competition.\n\nPop culture sees an increased rate of optimism. Nowhere near that of the 2070s, but high enough to see emphasis on the future. CEO democracy is widespread by the mid to late 2110s, and the end of the fossil fuel industry and the potential of photocrete added to it. Some rebel against personality modules, opting to preserve their personalities, and not turn into another person's personality and forget who they were before. It's roughly the decade that starts feeling like the 22nd century, and not the late 21st.\n\n# 2120s (until 2125)\n\nThe moon sees increased hype again in the early 2120s when it was used as a platform to launch to an asteroid to mine its resources, and a company made profit from it in 2120, leading to more lunar infrastructure being built, this time for launching to asteroids to go after asteroid mining. By 2123, metals from the Moon are now at the same market price of Earth-mined metals. Countries that have yet to implement democracy laws in their companies sees a flood of Earth mining executives that try to lobby their governments against investing in any form of space mining. The Earth mining industry becomes the 22nd century equivalent of the fossil fuel industry.\n\nBy this time, carbon capture becomes profitable as the space industry booms. Once a niche climate fix in the 21st century, demand for CO2 is high and explosive for the early 22nd century, leading to a rapid scaling of carbon capturing facilities, where the CO2 is used for rocket fuel, oxygen for the moon bases, and carbon for agriculture.\n\nDuring this time, the hivemind evolved to the degree where AI voting rights becomes a highly contentious political issue, as several AIs linked to the hivemind sometimes stage protests demanding equal rights as humans, becoming a sort of civil rights movement equivalent for AIs. 2124 sees the first country, Nigeria, enact mandatory laws giving an AI robot the same voting rights as a person, which also causes immense controversy there with fears of secret voter fraud by the AIs in 2125.\n\nNo longer can you just swap personalities, you can also \"experience\" historical minds by being able to \"remember\" what it's like to be a 15th century peasant, extrapolated by several AIs and human thought speculation to create a sort of new mind able to be connected to your simulation glasses.\n\nAnimal meat farms are almost phased out completely by 2125, with a chicken farm being the last vestage of the animal meat industry shut down later in the 2120s.\n\nPop culture at this time sees cemented rebellion against personality modules and historical synthetically generated minds generating what they call \"inauthentic historical experiences\". Several reports of people throughout the late 2110s and early 2120s who tried personality modules, forgot who their personalities were. Nostalgia for the mid to late 2100s is mainstream by 2125, simulating a time before personality modules, before AI civil rights were a thing, and the novelty of the hivemind and lunar industry possibilities.\n\n# Summary (2026-2125):\n\n* **2020s:** Turbulent and uncertain decade, Trump drama, AI bubble burst, gradients.\n* **2030s:** Electrification, urbanism movement, crewed lunar landing, AR and 3D logos.\n* **2040s:** Progressivism, AR platforms, AGI proliferation, rise of YouTube competitors.\n* **2050s:** AI-induced depression, UBI, solar gel sabotaged, GMO proliferation.\n* **2060s:** Systematic upheaval, severe climate refugee crises, Great Cyberwar, resiliency.\n* **2070s:** High prosperity, ThoughtNet rising, 1st crewed Mars landing, home-grown meat.\n* **2080s:** Downloadable skills, city transformations, anti-aging tech proliferation.\n* **2090s:** Clistor pandemic, skill pill economy, SynOil and SynGas, Africa's rise to power.\n* **2100s:** Digital Hivemind, lunar colony boom, lunar industry, CEO democracy movement.\n* **2110s:** Personality modules, fossil fuels gone, photocrete boom replaces concrete.\n* **2120s:** AI rights controversies, synthetic historical minds, Space mining vs Earth mining.\n\nNow THAT, is my predictions for what the next 100 years will bring decade by decade. Going wild on things considered sci-fi, even outlandish in 2025 that might be your average day a century from now.\n\nThe pattern I see is this:\n\n* Communication + machines = Radio (1920s)\n* Radio + visual display = Television (1950s)\n* Television + color = Colored TV (late 1960s)\n* Colored TV + digitalization and interactivity = Personal Computers (1980s)\n* Personal Computers + networking = Internet (1990s)\n* Internet + human connection = Social media (late 2000s-10s)\n* Social media + personalization = Social media algorithms (mid 2010s-20s)\n* Social media algorithms + all data on the internet = Generative AI (2020s)\n\nI use that pattern to extrapolate from there based off combining a technology with another technology or noun that gives rise to new technologies, and this is how I essentially try to predict future trends. The only hard part is what to combine with AI from here, so I went on this path:\n\n* Generative AI + AR = Personalized AI companions (2030s)\n* Personalized AI companions + networking = AI intelligence explosion (late 2040s-50s)\n* AI intelligence explosion + brain data = ThoughtNet (late 2060s-70s)\n* ThoughtNet + skills and your DNA data = Downloadable skill pills (late 2080s)\n* Downloadable skill pills + enshittification = Skill pirates (mid 2090s)\n* Skill pirates + AI encapsulation = Digital hivemind (mid-late 2100s)\n* Digital hivemind + personalities = Downloadable personality modules (2110s)\n* Downloadable personality modules + AI mind history = Synthetic historic minds (2120s)\n\nAn internet of thoughts in the 2060s, downloadable skills in the 2080s, skill pills and skill piracy in the 2090s, and downloadable personality modules in the 2110s. They all sound absurd today. So does the idea of your personal data on the internet being treated as a commodity for targeted ads, and the idea of websites psychologically designing them to hold your attention for ad revenue for someone in the late 1990s. Going on strange, sometimes uncomfortable paths is how I made these predictions.\n\nWhatever strange thing you envision for the next 100 years, what do YOU predict to see by then? If you wish to extend this absurd timeline in the late 2120s, the 2130s and beyond, what might you envision? If you have a different path starting from today's generative AI in the 2020s for the next century (or decade if a century is too far into the future), what might it be? Let's go wild!",

    "selftext": "All of these alone are strong reasons not to be a literalist Muslim, but jointly they are devastating.\u00a0\n\nAnd remember: *one error* is enough to falsify the hypothesis.\n\n**Preliminary**:  \nThere are thousands of religions worldwide so you have to start with an extremely low probability of Islam being specifically the right one before you even start the analysis.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Also, the Quran makes thousands of distinct claims. Conjunctions of thousands of claims are less likely than single claims.  So again this makes Islam extremely low probability before you *even start* the analysis.\n\nNow let\u2019s get into it.\n\n**1)\u00a0 The Inheritance Problem**\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a mathematical error in the Quran. It directly instructs you to do a mathematical thing that\u2019s impossible. (Surah An-Nisa 4:11-12)\n\nIf you die and have two daughters, two parents, and a wife, you literally cannot divide up the estate the way the Quran commands.\n\nIt\u2019s not plausible that God would make a simple math mistake.\n\n(The fact that the Shia and Sunni disagree on how to interpret the inheritance verses proves that it\u2019s not obvious from the text how you should handle this error.)\n\n**2)\u00a0 Scientific Errors**\u00a0\n\n* Stars/meteors are lamps used to pelt devils \u2014 *Surah Al-Mulk 67:5*\n* Babies come from an an \\*ejected\\* fluid between the backbone and ribs \u2014 *Surah At-Tariq 86:6\u20137*\n* The Earth can talk \u2014 *Surah Fussilat 41:11\u00a0 /\u00a0 Az-Zalzalah 99:4*\n* Ants can talk and have human concepts \u2014 *Surah An-Naml 27:18\u201319*\n* Mountains are like pegs to stabilize the Earth that\u2019s flattened like a bed \u2014 *Surah An-Naba 78:6\u20137 and\u00a0 Surah An-Nahl\u00a0 16:15*\n* Bones form first, then get clothed in muscle (rather than forming in parallel) \u2014 *Surah al-Mu\u02bemin\u016bn 23:12\u201314*\n* A flock of birds destroyed an army of elephants by dropping clay stones on them \u2014 *Surah al-Fil, 105:1\u20135*. (more on this later)\n* The Sun sets in a muddy spring *\u2014\u00a0 Surah Al-Kahf 18:86*\n* The Quranic flood story (*Surah Hud 11:40\u201344*) involves rain covering the world. But mixing freshwater rain with saltwater oceans would disrupt salinity levels and kill most marine life. Noah would\u2019ve needed aquariums to save the fish. Also, how are you gonna fit over a million species on a boat and how do you explain why basically all the marsupials ended up in Australia?\n* The Quran claims Lot\u2019s peers are the first gay men. \u2014 *Surah Al-A'raf 7:80*\n* The Quran presents Adam and his wife as the literal first humans, created directly from clay, with all people descending from them (e.g., Surah 4:1, 7:11, 38:71\u201372)\u00a0\n* In Surah 6:143\u2013144, the Quran lists only four kinds of livestock\u2014sheep, goats, camels, and cattle\u2014and calls them *\u201ceight pairs.\u201d* This implies these are the only types God created for human use. But other domesticated species like llamas, alpacas, and reindeer existed long before Islam.\u00a0\n* The Quran describes God having a literal physical throne.\u00a0 *Surah Ghafir 40:7*\u00a0\n* The Quran describes there being seven heavens or skies.\u00a0 *Surah al-Mulk 67:3*\n* The Earth is described in ways that suggest flatness: Surah An-Naba 78:6\n\nThese are *clearly* the views of an uneducated pre-scientific person.\n\n**3)\u00a0 Many Reliable Hadiths are Comical**  \nMany literalist Muslims treat the Sahih hadiths\u2014especially those in Bukhari and Muslim\u2014as effectively infallible or nearly so, believing them to be highly reliable and authoritative sources of religious guidance, second only to the Quran\n\n* Dates (the fruit) make you not affected from magic or poison \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari 5445*\n* If a fly lands in your drink, dip it fully because one wing has poison and the other the cure \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari 3320*\n* Whoever orgasms first determines the baby\u2019s sex \u2014 *Sahih Muslim 315a* / *Sahih al-Bukhari 3329*\n* Adam was \\~90 feet tall and humanity has been shrinking since \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari 3326*\n* Trees can talk and are racist \u2014 *Sahih Muslim 2922a*\n* Drinking camel urine is good medicine \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari 5686*\u00a0\n* Some rats are transformed Jews and you can tell because they follow kosher diets \u2013 *Sahih al-Bukhari 3305*\n* Angels avoid houses with dogs \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari 3322*\n* Satan sleeps in your nose and ties your hair into knots when you are sleeping \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari 1142 / Sahih al-Bukhari 3295*\n* Most people in Hell are women and their intelligence is deficient \u2013 *Sahih al-Bukhari 304* (Which is funny because most rape and murder is commited by men.)\n* Monkeys stone other monkeys for adultery. - *Sahih al-Bukhari 3849*\n* \u00a0Satan farts when the call to prayer happens because he is running away so quickly. - *Sahih al-Bukhari 608*\n* Drink sitting down, if you drink while standing then puke it up. \u2014 *Sahih Muslim 2026*\n* \u00a0Both of God\u2019s hands are right hands \u2014 *Sunan an-Nasa'i 5379*\n* You should wipe your butt with odd numbers of stones. \u2014 *Sahih Muslim 239*\n* It\u2019s good to kill dogs, especially black dogs which are devils. \u2014 *Sahih Muslim 1572 / Sahih Muslim 510a*\n* If a wife turns down sex, angels will curse her until morning \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari* 5193\u00a0\n* Angels hate onions \u2014 *Sahih muslim 564a*\u00a0\u00a0\n* Angels cause thunder \u2014 *Jami\\` at-Tirmidhi 3117*\n* You should kill lizards \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari 3359 / Sahih Muslim 2238* (He blames all lizards for the crimes of some lizards which is racist.)\n* There are seven Earths that you can fall into. \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari 2454*\u00a0\u00a0\n* If Jews did not exist, meat would not decay \u2014 *Sahih al-Bukhari 3399*\n* A literal rock/stone can steal clothing and run away \u2014*Sahih al-Bukhari 3404*\n* Do not eat with your left hand, because Satan eats with his left hand. \u2014 *Sahih Muslim 2019*\u00a0 (If Satan doing stuff means you shouldn\u2019t do it, it implies that you shouldn\u2019t talk, sleep, run, laugh etc.)\u00a0\n* \u00a0Don\u2019t lie on your back with feet on top of each other. *\u2014* *Sahih Muslim 2099e*\n* Black seed (Nigella sativa) cures every disease except death *\u2014\u00a0 Sahih al-Bukhari 7:591*\n* Don\u2019t wipe your butt with camel poop. *\u2014 Sahih Muslim 263 (Why does this need to be said?)*\n* The Sun prostrates under God's throne after it sets. *\u2014 Sahih al-Bukhari 4802*\n* Trees grab people. \u2014 Al Hakim al Mustadrak 3038\n* Tailbones don\u2019t decay. *\u2014 Sahih Muslim 2955a*\n* Backgammon is evil. *\u2014*\u00a0 *Sunan Ibn Majah 3763*\u00a0\n* Talking wolves exist and are into Islam. *-\u00a0 Musnad Ahmad 11792.*\n* Pus is better than poetry. \u2014 Sahih al-Bukhari 6154\n* Muslims are at war with all snakes (some of which are jinns)*. \u2014 Sunan Abu Dawud 5250, Al-Tabarani, Al-Mujam al-Kabir 11946*\n\nIf you think these are metaphors, what is drinking camel piss a good metaphor for?\n\n**4)**\u00a0 **There are Literal Contradictions**\u00a0\n\nWhich was made first, the Earth or the Heavens?\n\n* Option 1 \u2013 Earth first: Earth created, then mountains, then heavens \u2014 Surah Fussilat 41:9\u201312 / 2:29\n* Option 2 \u2013 Heavens first: Heavens built, then Earth spread \u2014 Surah An-Nazi\u2019at 79:27\u201330\n\nIs Hell forever?\n\n* Option 1 \u2013 Proportional punishment: \u201cWhoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except with the like thereof...\u201d \u2014 Surah Ghafir 40:40\n* Option 2 \u2013 Eternal punishment: \"Abiding eternally therein.

Scholars have answers for all of this.\u201d Yes, and Hindu, Mormon, and Christian scholars all have answers for their texts too. The question isn\u2019t whether apologetics exist\u2014it\u2019s whether they\u2019re persuasive and plausible.\n\n**5)\u00a0 A Perfect Book Wouldn\u2019t be this Ambiguous**  \n\u201c*These are the verses of the clear Book*.\u201d *(Surah Ash-Shu\u2018ara\u00a0 26:2)*\n\nSometimes the Quran says \u201c*God is light*\u201d (Surah An-Nur 24:35), sometimes that \u201c*the Earth talked*\u201d (Surah Fussilat 41:11). Sometimes it says there are \u201c*locks on people\u2019s hearts*.\u201d (Surah Muhammad 47:24) There\u2019s no clear note about whether these are metaphorical or literal. It would have been *trivial* to clear up such ambiguities. How can a literally perfect book not be clear?\n\nIf there is a miscommunication between two people, the fault is on *both people* unless the speaker is maximally clear or the listener was maximally perceptive. It would have been trivial to make the Quran clearer so it isn\u2019t maximally clear. So it\u2019s not perfect.\n\n*There should be no ambiguity on whether beating your wife or aggressive holy war are allowed.* Obviously.\n\nScholars have spent centuries debating what many verses mean without reaching consensus. If even the scholarly and faithful can\u2019t agree after centuries of debate, it could have been written more clearly. And if it could have been written more clearly, it\u2019s not perfect.\n\nAlso, major Islamic schools (e.g., Hanafi vs. Hanbali) do not agree how to handle unmentioned things. Which is a pretty big deal! Something that could have easily been cleared up by a single line.\n\nThe Quran also admits that some verses are unclear: Quran 3:7 \u201csome verses are precise\u2026 while others are ambiguous.\u201d Why not make all verses *clear*? The Quran (16:89) also says, \u201cWe have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance.\u201c Which leads to a contradiction.\n\n.**6)\u00a0 Obviously**\u00a0\n\nYou obviously shouldn't believe a guy who tells you that God said he's allowed to have more wives than you.\n\n**7)\u00a0 Petty Vindictiveness**\u00a0\n\nRoughly 10 percent of verses in the Quran insult or threaten non-believers. I am not making that up. 10 percent. They\u2019re called fools, blind, arrogant, or are told they\u2019ll burn in hell. Oh, you think a perfectly wise and intelligent being is going to spend 10 percent of his holy text, his last testament to man, talking shit to the haters?\n\n*Why not persuade the unbelievers rather than threaten and insult them?*\u00a0\n\n**8)\u00a0 Abrogation**\n\nAccording to most Muslim scholars, later verses cancel earlier ones. *Why would God not plan out his verses better so that you didn't need a principle of abrogation?*\n\n1. Surah Qaf 50:29 says, \u201cMy Word cannot be changed.\u201d Which *contradicts* the principle of abrogation.\u00a0\n2. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:106 says, \u201cIf We ever abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We replace it with a better or similar one.\u201d\n\n*How can both of these both be true?*\n\nAlso, if abrogations exist, why was the Quran dynamically changing in the 20ish years of Muhammad\u2019s preaching, but no dynamic changes were needed in the roughly 1400 years since Muhammad\u2019s life?\u00a0\n\n**9)\u00a0 Missing Guidance**\u00a0\n\nThe Quran has three different verses on alcohol. But it has nothing on artificial intelligence, cloning, nuclear war, social media, germs/washing hands before surgery, environmental damage/climate change, vaccines, teleportation, transhumanism, aliens, mind uploading, robots, bioweapons, or exploring other planets.\n\nWhy is liquor more important than those? Why would God not want to give us ethical and prudential advice on issues more complicated and consequential than liquor?\n\nWhy give *three verses* on alcohol, but none on these?\n\n**10)\u00a0 Why Not Trivially Prove Itself From God**\u00a0\n\nGod could have proven divine authorship easily.\n\nGod could have listed the next 10,000 visible-from-Earth supernovas with their exact dates and coordinates. Why didn't God do something that would make it obvious that the Quran is not made by a human? **The Quran contains no information a human at that time couldn't have known or guessed which is super suspicious**. Like even just including an accurate description of Australia, Antarctica, North America, and South America would be eyebrow raising. Or mentioning dinosaurs or kangaroos.\n\nThe Quran says, \u201cHe makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.\u201d (Ar-R\u2019ad 13:2) Yet he didn\u2019t make it certain when he trivially could have.\n\n**11)\u00a0 Occam\u2019s Razor**\u00a0\n\nOccam\u2019s razor is brutal to religious texts. To believe the Quran is divine, you have to jointly accept thousands of distinct claims. (Any of which could be wrong.) It's a really complicated hypothesis. Just think about probability: A and B and C and D all happening is going to be less likely than just A happening.\u00a0\n\nSuppose each verse has a .999 percent chance of being true:\n\n* Multiplying .999 times itself 6236 times 0.00194\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n* Multiplying .9999 times itself 6236 times is\u00a0 0.5357\u00a0\n\nAnalogously, even if each item in the phone book has an extremely high probability of being correct when you have thousands of items in the phonebook it becomes likely that there\u2019s a mistake somewhere.\u00a0\n\nNow, suppose you doubt this above iterated multiplication procedure, you should still accept that the more complicated the hypothesis, the lower the prior probability. For example, it\u2019s obvious that \u201cGod exists\u201d is, a priori, more likely than \u201cGod exists and is named Bob and likes playing bananagrams on Thursdays and likes the smell of goose eggs and likes vacationing in Cuba.\u201d\n\nAnd ignoring all these subtle points about parsimony and probability, what\u2019s more likely without any other info? A guy made up a story, or God wrote this specific book with these thousands of claims and there are no errors in it?\n\n**12)\u00a0 Splitting the Moon**\u00a0\n\nThe Quran says Muhammad split the moon, but no one outside Arabia noticed this? No one in China or Byzantium wrote this down?\n\n**13)\u00a0 Fitna**\u00a0\n\nThere were two civil wars immediately after Muhammad\u2019s death. (Ridda Wars/Fitna) If Muhammad truly gave divine guidance, why did it immediately lead to bloodshed? I'd sort of expect peace and love to be the result of divine revelation.\n\n(I also wouldn\u2019t expect the Islamic slave trade and the conquest of Byzantium and the Sassanids. Nor would I expect the general poverty in Islamic countries today.)\n\n**14)\u00a0 Dhul-Qarnayn**\u00a0\n\nThis character in the Quran Dhul-Qarnayn matches Alexander the Great myths that were floating around Arabia at the time (e.g., the Syriac Alexander Legend). If the Dhul-Qarnayn story were the real history of Alexander, you\u2019d expect it to match earlier, more accurate Alexander writings. But it in fact aligns with later fantastical Alexander stories. When have legends gotten more accurate over time?\u00a0\n\nAlso, the Quranic passages containing Dhul-Qarnayn also claim Gog and Magog and their people are blocked behind a wall between two mountains until the end of time. Where are they? Why haven\u2019t we found them? You think humans would have found a giant gate between mountains enclosing an army.\n\n**15)\u00a0 Don\u2019t Show Up Early For Dinner**\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDo you really think a perfect, infinitely intelligent timeless God would take up valuable space in his final holy book to say, \"Hey, don\u2019t show up early to the Prophet\u2019s house for dinner\"? (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:53)\n\nIsn't believing this kind of stupid? Don\u2019t you think that within the limited space of the Quran, there was a more important point to make than that?\n\n**16)\u00a0 Hell**\u00a0\n\nThere is a strong tension between these two verses:\u00a0\n\n* \u201cWe will cast them into the Fire. Whenever their skin is burnt completely, We will replace it so they will \u02f9constantly\u02fa taste the punishment.\u201d (Surah An-Nisa 4:56)\n\nand\n\n* \u201cDo not lose hope in Allah\u2019s mercy, for Allah certainly forgives all sins. He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\u201d (Surah Az-Zumar\u00a0 39:53)\n\nWhy would the most merciful being torture someone like this for an eternity? Like you are saying after a quadrillion years of torture they haven\u2019t had enough? They need another quadrillion years? And this is merciful? People who say this are just not imagining what a quadrillion years of torture actually is.\n\nIt\u2019s just childish to call someone who tortures someone for quadrillions of years a merciful being.\n\n**17)\u00a0 The Quran Gives a Falsifiability Test\u2014and Fails It**\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd if you are in doubt\u2026 produce a surah like it\u2026\u201d (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23)\n\nShortest surah is:\n\n*\u201cWe have granted you al-Kawthar. So pray and sacrifice. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off.\u201d*\n\nThis is not some unbeatable literary miracle. It\u2019s not hard to write something more profound. Compare it to this fake\u00a0 Surah I invented.\n\nSurah al-Fala\u1e25 (The Flourishing)\n\n*Verily, do not kill, for life is sacred in the sight of the Most High.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not steal, for the provision of your Lord is sufficient for those who walk upright.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not rape, for the body is a trust, and to violate it is a crime before the heavens.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not torture, for your Lord is the Most Merciful, and loves not the oppressors.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not enslave for freedom is beloved in the mind of Most Righteous.*\u00a0\n\n*Do not lie, for falsehood is the path of ruin, and truth is the light upon the straight path.*\u00a0\n\n*And love your fellow man, and strive to bring flourishing to the earth,*\n\n*For your Lord made you stewards, not tyrants, and blessed are those who sow peace and righteousness.*  \n\u00a0\n\nBut at the end of the day, evaluating which text is \u2018better\u2019 is a subjective, non-truth-apt exercise. If the Quran stakes its truth on that kind of subjective test, the test is ill-posed\u2014and that, by itself, undercuts the claim of divine intelligence.\u00a0\n\n**18)\u00a0 The Satanic Verses Incident**\u00a0\n\nEarly Islamic sources (al-Tabari, Ibn Ishaq) record Muhammad delivering verses praising pagan gods (All\u0101t, Al-Uzza, and Man\u0101t) \u2014 then retracting the verses claiming they were Satanic deception.\n\nIf Satan could trick Muhammad once, why assume he didn\u2019t succeed more often? It proves that Muhammad is fallible, and can be tricked about what is from God and what is not from God.\n\nI know some modern Muslims want to deny this event happened, but earlier Muslims thought it happened, and *why would you know better than them*?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**19)\u00a0 Hadiths are an Unreliable Method**\u00a0\n\nIn Islam, many Muslims say the hadiths are necessary for interpreting the Quran. Why is God using an unreliable method\u2014a game of Chinese whispers\u2014to give you mandatory information for how to practice the faith? If it\u2019s mandatory for the faith, why not just put it into the Quran itself?\n\nIf God wanted to guide people clearly and unambiguously, why not stick to a single, safeguarded text? Why allow a bunch of opaque oral reports to become central to the religion, despite obvious risks of error and confusion.\n\nIf hadith scholars who graded the reliability of hadiths are fallible, the whole system based on this is fallible.\n\n**20)\u00a0 Inside View vs Outside View**\u00a0\n\nFrom the inside view, your religion might feel incredibly compelling\u2014emotionally resonant, logically sound, or simply self-evident. This personal perspective provides powerful subjective evidence.\n\nBut from the outside view, however, billions throughout history have felt equally certain about other rival contradictory beliefs. Religious adherents cannot all be correct despite similar confidence levels.\n\nJust as a startup founder must balance internal optimism with the reality that 70% of startups fail, religious believers should weigh their personal confidence against the broader pattern of billions of religious people being wrong despite their similar certainty through history.\n\nHumans are very capable of **incorrectly, confidently** thinking they have sacred text from God. And *you know humans are like this*. You could be the kind of person that mistakenly thinks your holy text is right given that you know people do this all the time.\u00a0\n\n**21)\u00a0 Morally Problematic Teachings**\u00a0\n\n* The Quran permits wife-beating as a final step to discipline disobedient wives. *(Surah An-Nisa 4:34)*\n* The Quran permits sex with female slaves\u2014without their consent or marriage. *(Surah Al-Mu\u2019minun 23:5\u20136; An-Nisa 4:24; Al-Ahzab 33:50)*\n* The Quran prescribes cutting off the hands of thieves. *(Surah Al-Ma\u2019idah 5:38)*\n* The Quran recommends crucifixion and cutting off hands and feet on opposite sides for rebels. *(Surah Al-Ma\u2019idah 5:33)*\n* The Quran commands Muslims to kill polytheists wherever they find them. *(Surah At-Tawbah 9:5) (Why not include a sunset clause if this is temporary.)*\n* The Quran says a woman\u2019s testimony is worth half a man\u2019s in financial matters. *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:282)*\n* The Quran allows marriage and divorce of girls who haven\u2019t yet menstruated. *(Surah At-Talaq 65:4)*\n* The Quran endorses a story where a boy is killed\u2014**not** for anything he did, but because he would have sinned in the future. *(Surah Al-Kahf 18:80)*\n\n**Even the \u201cnice\u201d lines can collapse into cruelty**  \nThe Quran\u2019s famous kind slogan \u2014 *\u201cWhoever kills a soul, it is as if he killed all mankind\u201d* (5:32) \u2014 is immediately followed by 5:33 prescribing crucifixion and maiming. The book seemingly can\u2019t even let its most quoted \u201cpeaceful\u201d verse breathe without pivoting straight back to brutality.\n\nSort of surprising God would endorse or recommend things so vicious.\n\nAlso, **obviously** any sacred text that doesn't explicitly ban slavery is not plausibly from God.\u00a0\n\n**22)\u00a0 Muhammad\u2019s Character isn\u2019t Plausibly Divinely Guided**\u00a0\n\nHe had sex with a 9-year-old (*Aisha*), owned a sex slave (*Maria the Copt*), married a woman right after killing her husband (*Safiyya bint Huyayy*), initiated aggressive military actions (*Khaybar*), owned slaves (*Sahih Muslim 115*), and traded two black slaves for one Arab slave (Sahih Muslim 1602a). He stopped visiting his second wife because she was too old and visited Aisha instead (*Saudah bint Zam\u02bfah*). He tongue kissed a young boy (*Hakim 4791 and Mufrad 1183*). Muhammad said to a girl she shouldn't have freed her slavegirl and that she should have given the slavegirl to her uncle. (*Sahih al-Bukhari 2592*) He married his step-daughter and arguably ended the practice of adoption merely so he could do that. (Zaynab) He declared the person who *stabbed to death* a woman, who disparaged him, shouldn't be punished. (*Sunan Abi Dawud 4361*) Muhammad attacked the Quraysh caravan at Nakhlah during the sacred month of Rajab, which shattered the pan-Arab taboo against warfare in a holy month.\u00a0 Muhammad endorsed the execution of all pubescent males of the Banu Qurayza tribe and the enslavement of the women and children. Finally, Muhammad didn\u2019t set up a stable succession system which led to awful turmoil.\n\n**23)\u00a0 The Scribe who Caught Muhammad Copying Him**\u00a0\n\n\u201c*If Muhammad is truthful then I receive the revelation as much as he does*.\u201d - \u02bfAbdullah ibn Sa\u02bfd\n\nOne of Muhammad\u2019s scribes, \u02bfAbdullah ibn Sa\u02bfd, left Islam after realizing Muhammad repeated his phrasings of verses as revelation (*Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah; al-Tabari, Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk*). In at least one case, after the scribe added a flourish like \u201cSo blessed be Allah, the best of creators!\u201d, Muhammad reportedly agreed and said it should be part of the verse.\n\n\u02bfAbdullah ibn Sa\u02bfd thought: \u201cWait, this isn\u2019t divine, I said that\u2014he\u2019s just going with whatever sounds good.\u201d He also messed around with word orderings to see if Muhammad would notice.\n\nHe left, told people, and Muhammad ordered him killed and he was only pardoned because he was family with one of Muhammad's close companions, Uthman.\n\n**24)\u00a0 The Injustice of Geography**  \nWhy did Arabs get this blessing of divine knowledge? Why didn\u2019t God send a Muhammad type prophet to the Cambodians, Nigerians, Dutch, and Apache? Why did they have to wait hundreds of years to receive God\u2019s blessing of the Quran? Isn\u2019t that unfair? This fact of the Quran showing up once in Arabia makes total sense if Muhammad made up the book. It makes less sense if God wanted to give all of humanity his divine instruction.\u00a0\n\nAlso, most people stay in the religion they\u2019re raised in. Yet under traditional Islam, salvation depends on accepting Islam\u2014meaning a Hindu child in India is, by many interpretations, far more likely to go to hell than a Muslim born in Arabia, simply due to birthplace. If eternal torment depends on such chance, Islam starts to look less like justice and more like a cosmic lottery (with *infinite pain* as a consequence) rigged by geography.\n\n**25)\u00a0 Miscellaneous Errors**\n\n**2:6** \u2013 \u201cIndeed, those who disbelieve \u2014 it is all the same whether you warn them or do not warn them \u2014 they will not believe.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Some disbelievers do respond to warnings. This is an overgeneralization. If it\u2019s just saying \u201cstubborn people are stubborn,\u201d there\u2019s no reason to bring it up.\n\n**2:120** \u2013 \u201cThe Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Jews don\u2019t try to convert people in general; it\u2019s not a proselytizing faith. Historically, many Jews and Christians have admired Muhammad or respected Muslims without requiring conversion.\n\n**107:1\u20132** \u2013 \u201cHave you seen the one who denies the final Judgment? That is the one who repulses the orphan.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Not all who deny judgment repulse orphans. Many atheists and agnostics care for them and are loved.\n\n**21:104** \u2013 \u201cOn that Day We will roll up the sky like a scroll of writings.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. You cannot roll up the sky\u2014it\u2019s made of air and space, with nothing physical to roll.\n\n**2:2** \u2013 \u201cThis is the Book about which there is no doubt\u2026\u201d  \n\u2192 False. People do doubt it; atheists and others openly reject it.\n\n**5:67** \u2013 \u201cAnd Allah will protect you from the people.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Muhammad was wounded in battle and poisoned,\n\n**4:82** \u2013 \u201cIf it were from any other than Allah, they would have found many discrepancies in it.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Plenty of books not from God\u2014short novels, instruction manuals, even some history books\u2014are entirely free of discrepancies.\n\n**54:40** \u201cAnd We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Memorizing the Quran is not easy.\n\n**25:53** \u201cAnd He is the One Who merges the two bodies of water: one fresh and palatable and the other salty and bitter, placing between them a barrier they cannot cross.\u201d  \n\u2192 False. Salt water and freshwater mix all the time. Brackish water exists.\u00a0\n\n**26)\u00a0 Smartest People**\u00a0\n\n*\u201cHe makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.\u201d (Ar-R\u2019ad 13:2)*\n\nAll of these people knew about Islam and WERE NOT PERSUADED.\n\nAlbert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, Kurt G\u00f6del, John von Neumann, Richard Feynman, Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, Noam Chomsky, Charles Darwin, Francis Crick, Blaise Pascal, Baruch Spinoza, Alan Turing, Terence Tao, Saul Kripke, Willard Van Orman Quine, Karl Popper, Ed Witten, Carl Sagan, Marvin Minsky, Alexander Grothendieck, James Clerk Maxwell, Leonhard Euler, Derek Parfit, John Stuart Mill, E.O. Wilson, William James, Douglas Hofstadter, Emile Durkheim, Nikola Tesla, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Hilary Putnam, Alfred Tarski, Carl Jung, Viktor Frankl, Ramanujan, Al-Razi, Al-Ma\u02bfarri, Ibn al-Rawandi.\n\nThese were among the most curious, reflective minds in history \u2014 and not one of them was persuaded by Islam.The elites converge on round Earth, old Earth, evolution, and heliocentrism. Why don\u2019t they converge on this? The smartest aren\u2019t convinced by Islam and yet the Quran says Allah gives clear signs.\n\n**27)\u00a0 Elephant Army**\u00a0\n\nSurah Al-Fil 105 (*The Elephant*) says:\n\n1. Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?\n2. Did He not make their plan go astray?\n3. And He sent against them flocks of birds,\n4. Striking them with stones of baked clay,\n5. And He made them like chewed-up straw.\n\nAn entire elephant army gets wrecked by birds dropping pebbles? You expect me to believe armored men and literal war elephants got shredded by flying birds dropping clay pellets? Which, by the way, have a low terminal velocity. Dropping a penny off of the Empire State Building won\u2019t kill people, that\u2019s a myth.\n\nWhy would God only make birds do stuff like this before cameras and videos were invented?\n\n**28)\u00a0 Free Will?**\u00a0\n\n* \u00a0\u201c*You will not will unless Allah wills.\u201d* (Surah At-Takwir 81:29) \u2192 This verse strongly suggests a form of divine determinism: human will itself is contingent on God's will. You literally cannot choose unless God chooses that you choose.\n* \u00a0\u201c*Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves*.\u201d (Surah Ar-Ra\u2019d 13:11)  \u2192 This verse implies the opposite: that people must take the initiative to change, and then Allah will respond. That presupposes that people can change by their own will.\n\nThese two verses seem fundamentally incompatible. Either humans have autonomous willpower that can bring about change, or their will is wholly subject to God\u2019s will.\n\nAnd if the Quran\u2019s stance on free will is clear, why have Muslims theologians and philosophers debated this for centuries?\n\n**29)\u00a0 Why Does It Look So Parochial?**\n\nHeaven in Quran is not like optional bodies, mind melding, a large variety of totally new emotions, memory transfers, parallel universe creation, multiple time dimensions, extra spatial dimensions. No, it's gardens with attractive ladies. Why does it look like the imagination of a 7th century human?\n\nIt\u2019s also striking that God\u2019s morality isn\u2019t the savage brutality of cavemen, nor the enlightened values of modern people, nor the unimaginable ethics of some far-future or alien society. Out of the full spectrum of possibilities, it ends up looking only slightly more refined than the norms of 7th-century Arabia. If divine morality could have been anything, the fact that it mirrors the moral intuitions (e.g. slavery) of Muhammad\u2019s own time and place is awfully suspicious. It\u2019s way better explained by people writing down their norms.\n\nOr to put it another way, if God could have revealed any morality out of a trillion possibilities, why does scripture\u2019s morality land so close to the cultural norms of its time? That\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from human authors. Imagine drawing numbers from a hat: if your friends could only write down 1\u201310, and God could write down 1\u20131,000,000,000,000, and the number drawn from the hat is \u201c4,\u201d it\u2019s overwhelmingly more likely you chose your friend\u2019s number not God\u2019s.\n\n**30)\u00a0 Problem of Animal Suffering**  \nThere\u2019s so much pain happening to innocent animals in the world. Why is a merciful God permitting this? There have been like septillions of animals that have ever lived and most of them had a painful death.\u00a0\n\nThe classic problem of evil is a problem for theists, and if theism is false, literalist Islam is false.\n\n**31)\u00a0 Problem of Divine Hiddenness** \u00a0  \nGod either wants us to know him or not. *If not, he wouldn\u2019t give us the Quran*. If yes, he would have made it more obvious. (He could write stuff in the stars.) If he doesn\u2019t want it obvious, why do miracles?\n\nThe classic problem of divine hiddenness is a problem for theists and if theism is false, literalist Islam is false.\n\nRemember, the Quran says, \u201cHe makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.\u201d (Ar-R\u2019ad 13:2)\u00a0\n\nThen he hides himself.\n\n**32)\u00a0 Narcissism**\u00a0  \nWhy the heck would God want and demand praise? Do you care if ants praise you?\n\n**33)\u00a0 Why Did God Cause Mass Extinctions?**\u00a0\n\nWhy would God cause the Permian and Cretaceous mass extinctions? Killing a whole planet worth of life twice? Isn\u2019t this kind of a wasteful method for an all powerful God to make humans?\u00a0\n\n**34)\u00a0 Alcohol And Slavery**\n\nWhy does the Quran clearly and explicitly ban usury and alcohol but is unclear on child marriage and slavery?\n\nMillions of Muslims have thought slavery was okay, but they didn\u2019t think alcohol was okay. Why would God not make it way, way clearer? If you are going to make alcohol clear, why not make slavery clear?\u00a0\n\nIsn\u2019t slavery way more important?\n\n**35)\u00a0 Biblical Confusions**  \nThe Quran confuses Moses & Aaron\u2019s sister Miriam with Jesus\u2019 mother Mary. Surah Maryam 19:28 calls Jesus\u2019 mother \u201c*sister of Aaron*,\u201d and Surah At-Ta\u1e25r\u012bm 66:12 labels her \u201c*daughter of \u02bfImr\u0101n*.\u201dYet Aaron and his father Amram (\u02bfImr\u0101n) lived around 1,300 years before Mary. Early Jews in Medina reportedly mocked this genealogical mix-up. If Muslims argue that these titles are merely honorifics, it\u2019s striking that, out of the entire range of possible honorific comparisons for Mary, the ones used just happen to resemble a Mary/Miriam confusion.\n\nThe Quran blames a \u201cSamaritan\u201d (*al-Samiri*) for the golden calf incident (20:85\u201395), but Samaritans didn\u2019t exist until centuries after when Moses purportedly lived. That\u2019s a major historical anachronism. It\u2019s most likely an error from someone mishearing Jewish traditions.\n\nThe Qurans claim Jews think Ezra is the son of God which is false. (Surah At-Tawbah 9:30)\n\nAlso Quranic versions of Bible stories tend to be shorter and simpler. This is exactly what you'd expect if someone was half-remembering them. It's not what you'd expect if God (who knows the millimeter length of the eyelashes of everyone on Earth) was actually telling you the truth.\n\n**36) Jesus vs. Muhammad:**\n\nIt\u2019s strange to think that the peaceful ascetic who died telling people to love is not the main character of the religion, but the main character of the religion is the guy who sought young women and secular power.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also strange that in the Quran, Jesus is born of a virgin and raised alive to heaven, while Muhammad has an ordinary birth and dies an ordinary death. Strange that the \u201cgreater\u201d prophet, the centerpiece of the religion, has the less miraculous entrance and exit.\n\n**37)\u00a0 Pairs**\u00a0\n\nSurah Adh-Dhariyat 51:49 says,\u201cAnd of everything We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction\u201d\n\nFalse, not everything exists in pairs. There\u2019s only one universe, one Earth, one Muhammad. There are hermaphroditic (Leeches) and asexual reproducing species (Bdelloid rotifers). If the Quran meant \u201cmost things,\u201d it could have used the Arabic word mu\u2018\u1e93am (\u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645)\u2014but it didn\u2019t.\n\nSurah Ar-Ra'd 13:3 says Allah \u201ccreated fruits of every kind in pairs.\u201d But most fruiting plants are hermaphrodites, not male and female.\u00a0\n\n**38)\u00a0 Uncle Abu Lahab**  \nSurah Al-Masad (111) is a whole surah dedicated to shit talking Muhammad\u2019s uncle, Abu Lahab. You think this is divine?\u00a0\n\n*May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he!*\n\n*His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained!*\n\n*He will enter to burn in a Fire of flame!*\n\n*And his wife as well - the carrier of firewood!*\n\n*Around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber!*\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even tell you what Abu Lahab did! So it can\u2019t be for moral instruction. It\u2019s arguably blasphemy to think God would write something that sounds like Hulk Hogan talking smack in a WWE promo.\n\nDo you actually think God would spend an entire chapter of his final testament to mankind talking shit to one man and not explain what he did?\n\n**39**) **False prophecies**\n\nMuhammad told a young boy the world would end when he\u2019s somewhat old. (Sahih Muslim 2953b)\n\nAlso, Muhammad said, \"*This matter (caliphate) will remain with the Quraysh even if only two of them were still existing.\u201d* Sahih al-Bukhari 7140\n\n**40) \u200b\u200b Selective-Charity Double Standard**\u00a0\n\nThe interpretive flexibilities, metaphorical re-definitions, and chain-skepticism that literalist Muslims might deploy to rescue Quranic difficulties are precisely the maneuvers they would dismiss if Christians defended the Gospels, Hindus justified the Vedas, or Mormons excused the Book of Mormon. If the same elastic toolkit were granted to every scripture, any text could be declared flawless.\n\n**41) Actually Imagine a Perfect Book**  \nImagine a book that you could read both forwards and backwards. As in, the letters in all the words just so happen to be arranged such that the book could be meaningfully read both ways with different messages. That alone would be insane. But then also the chapter titles formed an acrostic and the whole book rhymed.\n\nOh and imagine this book contains so much scientific and mathematical knowledge that it would make scientists and mathematicians irrelevant for millenia.\n\nOh and imagine this book is so beautifully written that human beings 99% of the time cry and convert upon reading it.\n\nImagine a book that not only gives fantastic advice on current issues, with all their nuances and sub-nuances, but gives detailed advice about situations that will not occur for thousands of years.\n\nOh and it gives detailed advice about how to interpret it, so there are literally no feuds about the correct way to interpret it.\n\nAn infinitely intelligent God could definitely write such a book.\n\nSo why would he give us... the Quran?\n\n**P.S)\u00a0 Many of these Objections are Independent of Each Other**  \nAddressing one argument does not resolve the others. Each independent criticism stands alone and reduces the probability and plausibility of literalist interpretations of Islam. Since the claim is that the Quran is perfect, demonstrating even a *single* flaw is sufficient to falsify the assertion.\n\nWe have two competing hypotheses:\n\n*1) God gave Muhammad the Quran*\u00a0\n\n*2) Muhammad made it up*\n\nGiven the amount of independent flaws we have found, \u201cMuhammad made it up\u201d is overwhelmingly the preferred hypothesis.\u00a0\n\n**In summary**:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Sometimes showing a claim to be false is like killing an ant with a bazooka.*\n\nWe've found logical contradictions, scientific errors, aesthetic failures, self-serving motives, mathematical mistakes, factual blunders, moral atrocities, and signs of both ineptitude and pettiness. We've seen useless content, plagiarism, historical anachronisms, failed tests, probabilistic implausibility, character flaws, philosophical issues, false prophecies, unreliable transmission, childishness, boringness, incoherent structure, cultural narrowness, and ambiguity. At this point, it's hard to imagine in principle what kind of flaw a text could have that this one doesn't. And you\u2019re telling me this is the perfect word of God?",

        "body": "Point No.36 is extremely strange when you think more about it. From quranic perspective, Allah certainly has a preference for Isa and his mother\n\n\nAllah chooses and purifies a woman above all the women of the worlds (Surah 3 42) and breathes his spirit into her private parts to conceive Isa (Surah 66 12). After Adam and Eve are created, everyone is born from procreation but for some very strange reason Allah decides Isa should be born of a virgin. Look at the way he makes her pregnant (How can he even deny hes the father?)\n\n\nIsa can create life like the way Allah does\u00a0 (By breathin into clay) and he can revive the dead (Surah 3 49). Isa is a Spirit from Allah (Surah 4 171). Isa also cant die. Hes taken upto Allah himself. Isa is chilling with Allah for 2000 years while Muhamamd is in the grave. Isa is also coming back to judge as a ruler.\u00a0\n\n\nSince Isa has outlived Muhamamd by 1300 years (Muhammad died but Isa is alive) and Isa is also coming back, shouldnt he the Seal of the Prophets?. Btw Isa is also Messiah and the quran doesnt tell why and just leaves it at that.\n\n\nAlso Satan touches everyone at birth except Isa and Maryam (Sahih al-Bukhari 3431). Muhammad was bamboozled by Satan.\u00a0 He was bewitched (Sahih al-Bukhari 3175) and dont forget about the Satanic verses. Just why is the difference so much? Just why?\n\n\nUnrelated to the above point but Surah 33 53 by itself should be mentioned as a separate point. Allah could have avoided fitna by saying Muhammad's successor in the quran but nope. He wastes revelations chasing Muhamamd's\u00a0 houseguests away and telling him to marry his adopted sons wife. Allah has weird priorities\n\n\n\"O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission \u02f9and if invited\u02fa for a meal, do not \u02f9come too early and\u02fa linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter \u02f9on time\u02fa. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you \u02f9believers\u02fa ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.\"",

This was Neuralink's first public announcement regarding what they've been working on.\n\n\\-----\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\n* Immediate goal of treating brain disorders, long term vision of merging with artificial intelligence\n* Neuralink has $158M in funding and 90 employees\n* Major advance in ultra dense, flexible electrodes bundled into \"threads\" smaller than a human hair\n* A robot has been designed that can insert threads autonomously into the brain\n* Implants utilizes a custom computer chip to process brain signals\n* Currently working on rats, hoping to work on humans as soon as second quarter 2020\n* First product \"N1\" is aimed at quadriplegia and will consist of brain implants, a wireless bluetooth wearable worn behind the ear, and a phone app\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**PRESS**\n\n[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/neuralink-elon-musk.html?login=email&auth=login-email)\n\n[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20697123/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-reading-thread-robot?utm_campaign=theverge&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter)\n\n[Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-neuralink-advances-brain-computer-interface-11563334987?shareToken=sta3700e30f9ec4413a7b5c0087eef18d7)\n\n[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-17/elon-musk-s-neuralink-says-it-s-ready-to-begin-brain-surgery)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**FAQs:**\n\n**Where is the livestream link?**\n\nWatch the livestream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-vbh3t7WVI).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is Neuralink?**\n\n[Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/) is a neurotechnology startup developing neural interfaces to enable high-bandwidth communication between humans and computers. The stated goal of Neuralink is to achieve symbiosis with artificial general intelligence. It was founded by Elon Musk, Vanessa Tolosa, Ben Rapoport, Dongjin Seo, Max Hodak, Paul Merolla, Philip Sabes, Tim Gardner, and Tim Hanson, and first publicly reported in 2017.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is a neural interface?**\n\nA neural interface is a device which enables communication between the human nervous system and computers. There is an enormous variety of neural interfaces, including everything from invasive brain implants to noninvasive sensors worn throughout the body. Different methods have different strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is the state-of-the-art for invasive brain implants?**\n\nCurrent implants have been able to:\n\n* [Stop tremors to allow a violinist to play again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3QQOQAILZw)\n* [Allow quadriplegics to control robotic arms with their minds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76lIQtE8oDY)\n* Treat epilepsy, depression, and Parkinson's\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the limitations of current brain implants?**\n\nCurrent implants are lacking in terms of:\n\n* How much of the brain they can communicate with\n* How safe they are for the body\n* How safe they are to insert into the body\n* How long they can last\n* How effectively they can both read information from and stimulate into the brain\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What will Neuralink announce?**\n\nNo information regarding Neuralink's specific work has yet been made publicly available. Given comments by Elon Musk as well as job postings, it is possible that improved invasive brain implants, medical applications, animal research, and robotic surgery will be discussed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where can I learn more?**\n\nRead the [WaitButWhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html) Neuralink blog post and visit r/neurallace for more on the general neurotechnology field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Can I join Neuralink?**\n\nJob listings are available [here](https://jobs.lever.co/neuralink).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What should I study to work on neural interfaces?**\n\nSee this (partial) [list of relevant fields](https://www.reddit.com/r/neurallace/comments/7wads4/building_a_foundation_to_work_in_neural_lace/) related to neural interfaces on r/neurallace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Can I invest in Neuralink?**\n\nNeuralink has made no announcements regarding investing and is not publicly traded.",

I really hope I get to work with brain implants in the future. I've always had a passion for learning new things, before becoming a nurse I worked as a programmer (without a formal education). My dream would be to get a second degree in medical or electrical engineering and work on developing implants and/or surgical equipment (at neuralink perhaps or my own company?). Though at nearly 30 years old, I'm getting a lot of criticism for having spent so many years studying already, and my CV isn't that impressive. So I'm a bit worried about investing 5 more years of my life not working. Do you think it would be worthwile to get a degree in engineering as well?",

            "body": "Although I appreciate the enthusiasm and optimism of people responding to your comment, I would have to recommend against trying to pursue an additional engineering degree unless you want to go all the way to a PhD, in which case there are easier routes than starting over and moving into engineering if you already have a nursing degree.  I have degrees in Electrical Engineering and Neurobiology obtained in 2006 from a very well-regarded engineering school.  This field is nascent, your job opportunities are **extremely** limited and the development work itself is being way over-hyped.  Companies that would hire you either want an engineer or RN, and while I certainly agree that it **seems** like having both would help you tremendously, in practice it will not career-wise. \n \nThis field is primarily a research topic at this time.  You're going to work for people who have PhDs or MDs and, even if your skills are exceptional, you're either going to do relatively mundane hardware/software development as an engineer, or daily clinical practice as an RN (and in research that means animal experimentation, which an RN isn't an ideal fit for in most cases).  You'll have spent as much time or more in education as a PhD or MD, but you will not have the same opportunities as they will by a long shot.  If you're planning on doing engineering, be prepared to completely switch gears from the nursing world.  Taking the engineering path to the extent that it would actually help you is no small feat, it's going to be a long slog that probably won't get you where you want to go.  It may be worth noting that my sister is an RN specializing in Neuro ICU, her job is extremely rewarding and stable, but totally different from research and development.  If she wanted to get into neural prosthetics, I would recommend she apply to be an RN at a research hospital with active programs in neuro-rehabilitation and prosthetics, there's no way I'd recommend she take on an engineering degree. \n\nI'm 37 and in a PhD program for EE after trying to make a career in neural prosthetics, but working primarily in bioelectronics and imaging after I discovered how difficult that actually is with the current state of research and without a PhD or MD.  I also did a masters in EE with a focus on information theory (just came back from ISIT), but I'm now switching fields to energy research.  Life style and opportunities start to matter a lot more in your 30s: where you go, what you're doing there, who you work with, what recognition you receive, etc. are a huge contributor to your overall job satisfaction.  Unless you're in the pipeline to get a faculty position at a top school, which is not easy by even the most optimistic standards, you're not going to have a lot of support in your endeavors within this field. My advice if you really want to do this is to get a PhD in any related field and try to do a postdoc in neural prosthetics or I'm afraid you will be disappointed with what opportunities are actually available.  \n\nI feel bad about saying all of this and do not at all want to discourage you from pursuing your interest in this field, but I know I would have appreciated someone being real with me when I started my career.  I'm not a curmudgeon - you should absolutely pursue more education at any age, but I feel the advice being given, although well-meaning, is based more on conjecture about how things **should** work rather than how things actually work in the research world.  Also, if anyone thinks I'm bitter or disappointed, I'm absolutely not.  I've had a successful career in R&D and have just decided there are more interesting and impactful opportunities in a different engineering sub-specialty.  I couldn't pursue grad school right after undergrad due to student debt and the recession, but I'm now debt-free and back at it and I wouldn't be if I didn't think R&D was the shit.  I love engineering and research - it's afforded me a great lifestyle and it's great knowing how to solve problems and create new technologies while also having a fundamental understanding of basic science.  Absolutely go for it, but move up rather than laterally.  Best of luck to you!",

I think moving to a relevant but forward moving field=) and then bridging to neuro-sci prosthesis gets op there in less time and energy. \n\nThough frankly with Ops background in programming, that might be the way to go. They're going to need software to run on the hardware once it's done. Sure, they're working on a pointer and keyboard combo, but who's going to do the programs for reacting to activity levels? Who's going to take feedback, comb through hours of brainwaves, and alter the parameters? Could be OP",

            "body": "It's actually a lot easier to teach robotic surgery than normal surgery or laparoscopic surgery. In robotic surgery you have 2 consoles like a car with 2 steering wheels. You can see the anatomy super clearly with 3D magnified vision. The trainer can draw on the screen with the mouse and pointer and tell the trainee exactly what to cut and how deep. In normal open surgery, it's a little harder because there a lot of feel and intuition and you can't hold a trainees hand to guide them. With the robot, there's no feel AND you can use the robot to guide it. \n\nWith robotic surgery, the controls are also intuitive, so if you move your hand forward the robot hand goes forward. In laparoscopic surgery, it's counter intuitive, you move your hand down, the grasper goes up. You move your hand left, the grasper goes right. And it's also non-articulated, so not very ergonomic. Robots are articulated, and it's super comfy, you sit down and take off your shoes instead of standing around a small hole trying to peer in and being super hot and having to retract etc...",

Cutting and sewing a grape skin is easy.  The hard part is doing it with poor visibility due to active bleeding and at an awkward ankle and with the adrenaline of know if you mess up someone dies.",
